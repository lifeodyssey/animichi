# Architecture

> **Visual companion:** [architecture-diagrams.md](./architecture-diagrams.md) — 5 agent-scoped Mermaid diagrams: the agent and its direct dependencies, one turn end to end, the typed tool-outcome contract, the model layer, session state & multi-turn selection.


## Overview

*Agent file references below are relative to `apps/agent/src/animichi/` (src-layout, #651); worker and web paths are repo-root relative.*

```
User text → RuntimeAPI.handle() → run_animichi_agent() → animichi_agent.run()
  → catalog/web tools → AgentResult (typed output + steps + SessionState)
  → agent_result_to_response() → PublicAPIResponse

For deterministic selections:
  User selection → execute_selected_route() → AgentResult → PublicAPIResponse
  Clarify choice → execute_multi_selection() / execute_place_selection()
    → AgentResult → PublicAPIResponse
```

Entry path: `HTTP service → RuntimeAPI → run_animichi_agent() → animichi_agent.run()`

No hardcoded anime list. DB is source of truth.

## Agent runtime today — two tiers, one flag

A chat turn can be answered by either of two runtimes, and `AGENT_TURN_ROUTE` picks which:

- **Container tier (the default).** The Python FastAPI agent in `apps/agent/`, run as a Cloudflare
  container through `RuntimeContainer` (`workers/edge/src/entry.ts`). It owns the whole turn:
  admission, the PydanticAI loop, the catalog tools, session persistence, and the anonymous cost
  and message walls. Its cold start is what the rewrite below exists to delete, so while this tier
  serves, X2's warm p95 ≤3s **first-token SLO** stays a hard requirement.
- **Edge tier (staging today).** `workers/edge/src/agent/` — the turn runs inside an `AgentSession`
  Durable Object's `alarm()` handler and Neon is the only source of truth: intake writes the
  message, a `running` run and the quota reservation in one transaction, the DO replays tool steps
  by `(run_id, step_index)`, and settlement banks `daily_usage` and the run's terminal row.
  `workers/edge/src/db/schema.ts` is the query-side mapping of the tables the edge owns from W1.
  Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md`; package guide: `workers/edge/AGENTS.md`.

The flag has exactly two positions, and only the literal `"edge"` moves the three routes it covers
— `POST /v1/chat`, `POST /v1/byok/probe`, `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/messages`
(`edgeTierRoute` in `workers/edge/src/gateway/routing-policy.ts`) — onto the edge tier. Every other
value, typo included, keeps the container, because the safe side is the surface that has been
serving all along. In `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` the
default `[vars]` and `[env.production.vars]` hold `"container"` and `[env.staging.vars]` holds
`"edge"`: staging runs the rewrite, production does not, and the rollback is one word in that file
with no redeploy of anything else. The edge Worker reads the flag itself, so it is deliberately not
in `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`. `workers/edge/src/gateway/agent-tier-route.ts` documents the identity
ladder both positions share, and its one deliberate widening (an anonymous transcript GET).

D7 (2026-08) ruled on two proposed replacements for the container. **Pyodide: still rejected** —
the agent does not move into a Python Cloudflare Worker. **The TypeScript rewrite was rejected then
and reversed on 2026-09-01**; its Phase-0 spike gate (W0, real deployed Workers only — `wrangler
dev` did not count) closed 2026-09-03, and the current decision record is the spec above, which
supersedes SD-4 of `docs/specs/2026-07-06-frontend-rebuild-spec.md`. The retry and validation safety that the original
D7 comparison feared losing is carried by the spec's "submit_result tool + validation throw +
terminate" loop, not by a second retry stack.

## Request Modes — `interfaces/schemas.py`

`PublicAPIRequest` accepts exactly one runtime mode per turn: user `text`, direct
`selected_point_ids`, or `selected_candidate_ids` paired with a `clarification_id`. Candidate and
point selections are deterministic server paths and do not invoke the model.

## AgentResult — `agents/agent_result.py`

```python
@dataclass
class StepRecord:
    tool: str
    success: bool
    params: dict[str, object]
    data: dict[str, object] | None
    provenance: StepProvenance | None
    error: str | None = None

@dataclass
class AgentResult:
    output: AgentResultOutput
    steps: list[StepRecord]
    session_state: SessionState
```

Carries the typed terminal, every tool/server step, the authoritative typed session registry, and
current-turn provenance used by response projection and persistence.

## Pilgrimage Agent — `agents/animichi_agent.py`

- PydanticAI `Agent` whose `output_type` contains exactly `ClarifyResponseModel`,
  `SearchResponseModel`, `RouteResponseModel`, `GreetingResponseModel`, and `QAResponseModel`
- System prompt describes available tools; no hardcoded anime IDs
- `output_validator` rejects responses not backed by the current turn's typed provenance
- For any anime query: the agent calls `resolve_anime` first, then downstream tools
- `PartialResponseModel` and `BlockedResponseModel` are server-only runner terminals and are not
  model output types

## Tools — `agents/animichi_tools.py` + `agents/web_tools.py`

- Four catalog tools are registered from `animichi_tools.py`; two web tools come from `web_tools.py`
- Pydantic tool schemas constrain model-supplied parameters
- Tools access typed runtime dependencies via `RunContext`

### Tool registrations

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `resolve_anime` | Resolve a title through the catalog Worker and stage identity/clarification state |
| `search_bangumi` | Query catalog points for the resolved `bangumi_id` |
| `search_nearby` | Query catalog points by place name or caller coordinates |
| `plan_route` | Ask the catalog Worker to route an explicit search-result reference |
| `web_search` | Attributed web research for QA/title enrichment, never pilgrimage discovery |
| `translate_anime_title` | Catalog-backed or tool-less title translation |

## Runner — `agents/animichi_runner.py`

- `run_animichi_agent(...)` — runs the agent and collects typed steps/state into `AgentResult`
- Converts usage exhaustion to `PartialResponseModel` and enabled input-guard refusals to
  `BlockedResponseModel`
- Single entry point for the runtime API

## Selected Route — `agents/selected_route.py`

- `execute_selected_route(...)` — direct selected-point route execution without invoking the model
- `execute_multi_selection(...)` and `execute_place_selection(...)` consume validated clarify cards
  without invoking the model
- Returns `AgentResult` for consistency with the main path

## Retrieval — `agents/catalog_tools.py`

The four catalog data tools call the catalog Worker through `CatalogClientProtocol`. The agent has
no local retriever, handler registry, SQL route planner, or direct Anitabi/Bangumi request path.

## Public API — `interfaces/public_api.py`

- Stable request/response facade over `run_animichi_agent()` / `execute_selected_route()`
- Adds `ui: UIDescriptor` field to response
- One settled turn's durable effects — usage, anonymous quota, and the `request_log` audit row —
  are applied together on the caller's transaction by `interfaces/outbox_dispatch.py`
  (`SettlementApplier.apply_session`); the statements live in
  `infrastructure/persistence/repositories/feedback.py`. The audit half is best-effort and
  never raises
- Session persistence + route history

## HTTP Service — `interfaces/fastapi_service.py`

FastAPI, assembled from the routers in `interfaces/routes/`. The complete published path
inventory is `AGENT_PATHS` in `packages/contract/src/agent-paths.ts` — one declaration, read at
runtime by the edge's routing and rate tables, so nothing here mirrors it. The turn entry is
`POST /v1/chat` (`interfaces/routes/chat.py`), which answers with an SSE `EventSourceResponse`;
there is no `/v1/runtime` route and no `/v1/bangumi/popular`. Auth is NOT enforced here — it is
enforced upstream in the edge Worker.

## Response Contract

```typescript
interface UIDescriptor {
  component: string   // e.g. "PilgrimageGrid"
  props: Record<string, unknown>
}

interface PublicAPIError {
  code: string
  message: string
  details: Record<string, unknown>
}

interface PublicAPIResponse {
  success: boolean
  status: string
  intent: string
  session_id: string | null
  message: string
  data: Record<string, unknown>
  session: Record<string, unknown>
  route_history: Array<Record<string, unknown>>
  errors: PublicAPIError[]
  ui?: UIDescriptor
  debug?: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

## Catalog Ownership

The agent is a read-only catalog consumer. `resolve_anime`, pilgrimage search, geocoding, and route
planning all go through the catalog Worker. Catalog ingest/enrichment/publish jobs own Anitabi and
Bangumi access and decide which works are available; the runtime request path never grows the
catalog on demand.

## Auth Layer — `workers/edge/src/app.ts` + `workers/edge/src/identity/auth.ts`

The CF Worker establishes an identity before proxying to the container. It always strips
client-supplied `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Type` and re-injects the worker-verified values, so the
container can trust those headers unconditionally.

The identity matrix (AUTH-1 #945) is the explicit contract document
`packages/contract/src/identity-contract.ts` — per class (public / anonymous / authenticated) the
rate limit, daily message quota, and daily cost budget. The edge consumes its defaults
(`DEFAULT_IDENTITY_POLICY`, declared in the import-free `src/identity-policy.ts` so zod stays out
of the Worker bundle — #1285) and the deployed `wrangler.toml` values are pinned to it by
`workers/edge/test/identity-policy-matrix.test.ts`:

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` → verified against the branch's Neon Auth JWKS (`jose`, EdDSA) → `X-User-Type: human`. AUTH-2 #950 hard cut: `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` is the edge's ONLY identity source — the Supabase verifier and the dual-issuer flag are deleted, and issuer/audience are derived from the JWKS URL
- No credentials, on the anonymous allowlist → `X-User-Type: anonymous` (see below)
- No credentials, anywhere else → 401
- `sk_*` credentials are rejected as invalid — the API-key mint/verify path and the `api_keys`
  table are deleted; `"agent"` is no longer an identity class
- `/healthz`, the public catalog/`/v1` allowlist, and static assets bypass auth entirely

The edge verifies Neon Auth JWTs only (AUTH-2 #950); users and the agent trust the edge-forwarded
identity headers, never raw bearers.

### Anonymous access (X5, implemented in S1.8 / issue #274)

X5 previously described this as forward-looking; it is now the implemented state. `/v1/chat` is
open to callers with no session:

- **Identity** — the edge mints a random id, HMAC-signs it with `ANON_ID_SECRET`, and returns it as
  an opaque HttpOnly `aid` cookie. The container sees it as `X-User-Id: anon_<hex>` with
  `X-User-Type: anonymous`. A brand-new visitor is issued one on the spot; there is no
  minimum-history threshold. A forged or wrongly-signed cookie is discarded, not trusted.
- **Opt-in** — anonymous access stays off unless both `ANON_ACCESS_ENABLED=true` and
  `ANON_ID_SECRET` are set; otherwise `/v1/chat` keeps its 401.
- **Rate limiting** — `workers/edge/src/protect/rate-limiter.ts` applies a per-identity fixed window
  (`ANON_RATE_LIMIT` / `ANON_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`) backed by the `EDGE_GUARD` Durable
  Object, one shard per identity. Exceeding it returns a 429 the client renders as in-character
  "少し待ってね" copy.
- **Daily-budget circuit breaker (X4)** — every runtime turn banks its usage into the `daily_usage`
  table, partitioned by scope (`anon` / `user` / `byok`, plus `platform`). On the **container tier**
  the container ingress is the authoritative decider: it compares today's `anon` spend with
  `ANON_DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD` and rejects with 403 `anon_budget_exhausted`, which the client
  renders as login guidance. `workers/edge/src/protect/cost-breaker.ts` owns only that verdict's
  wire contract plus a same-UTC-day latch, so subsequent anonymous requests short-circuit without a
  container round-trip; the latch expires at the day boundary.
  **On the edge tier this ceiling currently has no decider.** Nothing under
  `workers/edge/src/agent/` reads `ANON_DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD` — the variable is only forwarded to
  the container (`workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts`) — and the latch waits on a container
  verdict that a turn served at the edge never produces. Tracked as EG-01 in
  `docs/specs/2026-09-05-repo-smell-audit.md` §1.2. What the edge tier does do with the table is
  WRITE it: settlement banks the day's row itself
  (`workers/edge/src/agent/settlement/neon-turn-settlement.ts`). Logged-in traffic is never gated
  on either tier.
- **Per-identity daily message quota (S1.10, issue #282)** — a fairness/UX mechanism, not a
  security defense line: an `anon_daily_message_count` row keyed `(usage_date, anon_id)` is
  atomically incremented and the turn is rejected with 403 `anon_quota_exhausted`
  (+ `quota_resets_at`, the next UTC midnight) once that one identity's own
  `ANON_DAILY_MESSAGE_QUOTA` is spent, so a single visitor's free usage stays reasonable while the
  shared budget above stays open for everyone else. `0` or unset disables it. Both tiers enforce
  it: the container ingress on the container path, and on the edge path the intake's own
  reservation upsert, whose returned count drives the refusal and rolls the whole turn back
  (`workers/edge/src/agent/intake/anonymous-message-allowance.ts`). On the container path it runs
  only after the budget breaker above allows the turn — the global dollar ceiling is the more
  severe, systemic concern and wins ties over one visitor's own message ceiling. Logged-in traffic
  is never gated.

## Web App

The browser surface is `apps/web/` (TanStack Start, deployed as its own Cloudflare Worker).
Its layout, routing, design tokens, and auth wiring are documented in `apps/web/AGENTS.md` —
that package is the source of truth, not this file.

<!-- historical: retired in #537 -->
Issue #537 deleted the legacy `frontend/` package and the root Worker's static-asset fallback
with it. The root Worker (`workers/edge/src/app.ts`) is now an API gateway only: `/v1/*`,
`/v1/users/*`, `/healthz`, `/img/*`, `/tiles/*`, one allowlisted public catalog read, and a JSON
`404 not_found` for everything else. It serves no HTML; `apps/web` owns every page.

## Eval Infrastructure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tests/eval/run_agent_eval.py` | Official-v1 runner: 8 metrics, statistical baseline + gate, streams per-case status |
| `tests/eval/datasets/agent_eval_v3.json` | Primary suite (662 cases, 66 paths, locales ja/zh/en) |
| `tests/eval/datasets/agent_eval_heldout_v1.json` | Held-out overfit guard (#416) |
| `tests/eval/datasets/injection_g1_v1.json` | Indirect-injection defense cases |
| `tests/eval/direct_gates.py` | Deterministic thrash gates (req/tool/repeat/p95) |

CI tiering (SD-30): `EVAL_SMOKE=1` capped run is an affected L0 lane in `.github/workflows/pr-verification.yml`; the
uncapped L1 suite owns the baseline and runs nightly via `.github/workflows/agent-eval-nightly.yml`. Both call the
local `.github/actions/agent-eval` implementation. Model, cost, and the run
recipe live in `apps/agent/AGENTS.md`; strategy in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

## Design Rules

- One agent: `animichi_agent` (PydanticAI) with typed output and `output_validator`
- Tools registered via `@agent.tool` with `ModelRetry` guards for parameter validation
- Selected-route path bypasses the agent entirely (`execute_selected_route`)
- Retrieval is structured-first — no semantic/vector search
- DB is source of truth for anime catalog — no hardcoded lists
- Auth is enforced at the CF Worker edge — container is not auth-aware
