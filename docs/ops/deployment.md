# Deployment

This is the canonical deployment runbook for the current runtime.
The old root `DEPLOYMENT.md` compatibility pointer was removed in iter6 A6 (#640); this file is the only deployment runbook.

This file covers non-secret runtime config. For what each GitHub secret is, who consumes it,
and rotation impact, see [`secrets.md`](./secrets.md).

## Delivery architecture

There are three workflow responsibilities:

- `pr-verification.yml` verifies pull requests and merge groups.
- `release-build.yml` builds a complete immutable snapshot on every main push and, once the upload
  has succeeded, dispatches `cd.yml` on `main` with that snapshot's own artifact ID.
- The main-only `cd.yml` controller deploys the selected existing artifact ID to staging, then
  promotes that same release after the actual production job's environment approval. A manual
  dispatch still selects any other eligible artifact, such as an older release or a re-deploy.

There is no tag-triggered or local deploy path. The protected branch still requires `PR Verification`
and `Security`, resolved review threads and the repository's review discipline.

### Native Agent release acceptance

The owner-approved 2026-09-10 delivery amendment separates complete code Stories from observations
that require a deployed native host. Storage #1541 and the atomic service cutover #1582 may merge
once their complete code/PR gates pass. [#1583](https://github.com/lifeodyssey/animichi/issues/1583)
preserves the original deployed duration, real-tool, recovery, APAC, resource/cost and applicable
native evaluation evidence. Missing evidence must block native production promotion; code merge
alone is not acceptance. Use main CD staging, the existing production approval and the same tested
artifact. The production dependency on this evidence is still an implementation requirement of
#1583, not a claim that today's workflow already enforces it. Revalidate affected evidence when the
artifact changes. [The canonical target](../specs/2026-09-09-agent-on-pi-harness-spec.md) owns the ACs.

### Affected-only PR CI

The affected set is pnpm's, not ours. `plan` runs
`pnpm ls -r --depth -1 --json --filter "...[<merge-base>]"`, which selects every workspace project
whose files changed plus every dependent of one, and subtracts the three projects that own a job of
their own: the root project (no lint/typecheck/test scripts), `@animichi/agent-python` (its `test` is
`uv run pytest`), and `animichi-e2e` (its `test` is the browser suite). Every selected package
becomes one `affected` matrix leg running that package's own `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and
`test:integration`. There is no component manifest and no second router: a package's lane is its
own `package.json`, which is also what `pre-push` runs.

Four paths sit outside the package graph and are routed by `dorny/paths-filter` instead:
`apps/agent/**` and `packages/contract/**` (the Python `agent` job), `apps/web/**`, `e2e/**` (the
browser job), `migrations/neon/**` (the schema job), and the root dependency files, whose change
means "every package" because pnpm answers a root-lockfile change with the root project alone.
The six security jobs are never path-gated. `PR Verification` and `Security` each aggregate their
dependencies with `always()` and fail on any failed or cancelled one.

### Build once, select an immutable artifact

Each successful main push selects its own snapshot: the builder dispatches `CD` on `main` with the
artifact ID it just uploaded, so staging needs no manual action while production keeps its approval.
Manual dispatch remains for a different release.

A → B → C on main deploys each push's own snapshot; selecting B's artifact ID instead deploys B's
full snapshot, including A's catalog/schema/foundation prerequisites, and does not require C. The
trusted controller checks out its dispatch SHA. B's release SHA must be in that main history,
but it need not equal the controller SHA or the latest remote main commit.

GitHub's official artifact API and pinned `actions/download-artifact` validate the explicit ID,
repository, producer run and attempt, successful main-push builder workflow, expiry and digest.
Consumers re-resolve these properties before credentials, including after production approval.
The action downloads by ID/run/repository and treats a digest mismatch as an error. An unavailable
artifact causes refusal; the controller never rebuilds it or substitutes another release.

The immutable tar contains all five Worker deployments: web output/assets, catalog, users, edge
and migrator bundles/configurations; the already-pushed agent image digest; the complete native Atlas
chain and baseline marker; the native Prisma contract and complete migration graph; and all tracked
Pulumi sources with the generated pinned Neon SDK.
The controller validates the archive boundary, required components, file digests and exact migration
and infrastructure source closure. Wrangler's pinned native parser seals and verifies configurations.
Artifact files cannot replace controller scripts or actions, and publication runs with `--no-bundle`.

The Turnstile site key is public configuration, not a sealed value. The staging `database-access`
stack adopts the account's one widget (`animichi.com (Spin)`, #1676) through its
`<account_id>/<sitekey>` import identity, so that widget's site key is committed as a `RUNTIME_CONFIG`
field in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` and every artifact byte stays exactly as built. The committed value
cannot drift unless the widget itself is replaced, and the CI lanes keep their own always-passing
Turnstile test keys (`e2e/playwright.config.ts`, `apps/web/tests/native-server.ts`).

One `stage` job holds `cd-staging` from preflight through foundation, migration, Worker publication,
smoke and receipt. One `promote-production` job holds `cd-production` and owns `environment:
production`. Its approval does not hold staging's lock. Both set `cancel-in-progress: false`; GitHub
retains its native single pending selection, so a pending selection may be replaced — including by
the next push's own snapshot. Active chains finish coherently. There is no workflow-wide lock,
commit-order queue or `queue: max` exception.

Before any Pulumi apply or Worker publication, both jobs inspect the real remote agent image manifest
and linux/amd64 configuration with Docker, then read actual migration compatibility from
the existing migrator's authenticated `/preflight`. Production refuses a staging-only baseline
before any mutation. After the Atlas check, CD retires the legacy migrator container application when
the selected snapshot carries the class-deletion contract, publishes only the selected migrator, waits for its
Atlas and Prisma bundle identities, and runs native Prisma read-only preview. Application foundation,
DDL and service publication remain gated behind that preview. Missing, empty, partially applied,
divergent or newer database history fails closed. A Wrangler dry run or `/healthz` response does not
prove the applied database state or registry availability.

The immutable staging receipt records artifact ID/digest, release/controller SHAs, actual per-script
Worker deployment/version IDs, configured container application/namespace/image identities, applied schema and
successful smoke. Container identity is read only after the application's configuration converges: an
image change creates an asynchronous rollout, so the receipt polls `configuration.image` under a bounded
budget (`CONTAINER_ATTEMPTS` x `CONTAINER_RETRY_DELAY` in `cd.yml`, 12 x 15 s, #1683) and otherwise fails
naming the expected digest, the last observed digest and the attempt count. It proves B was tested.
Later C staging can proceed while B waits for approval; production must still pass fresh
baseline/ledger/registry checks before promoting B. Version IDs are script-scoped and are not expected
to match between staging and production.

Native Minitest tests under `.github/test/` cover admission, source closure, archives, configurations,
remote identity validation, receipt validation and workflow order. The real Wrangler bundling test
also executes in CI's unconditional contracts job. The
[assertion map](../iterations/production-readiness-2026-08/SELECTED-ARTIFACT-ASSERTION-MAP.md)
traces every replaced CD contract. See [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-selected-release-artifacts.md) for the
activation prerequisites: deployed ledger preflight, same-lock revalidation, exact builder identity,
registry access, runtime secrets, baseline cutover and production routing must be established
before this controller can deliver successfully. Local tests do not prove those platform gates.

### Migrator container retirement (#1589)

The migrator applies both live migration owners in Worker code; it no longer builds or carries a
container image. Each root, staging and production Wrangler migration chain preserves the historical
`MigrationContainer` creation tag and appends the unique
`v3-retire-migration-container` `deleted_classes` tag. `MigratorApplyLock` remains bound in every
ring because it serializes and revalidates the live apply.

The environment-scoped CD job performs retirement in this order:

1. Call the already-serving migrator's authenticated Atlas-only preflight.
2. If the selected environment config has no container and includes the class-deletion tag, list
   every application page and delete only the pinned old environment application by ID. Absence is
   an idempotent success only after the cursor is exhausted; API, malformed-page, repeated-cursor,
   page-limit or duplicate exact-name failures fail closed.
3. Deploy the selected migrator bundle and its `deleted_classes` migration, then wait for the native
   graph and continue the normal database and service chain.

This order is deliberate. Cloudflare's
[legacy Durable Object migration guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-object-class-migrations-legacy/)
requires removing the binding and code and deploying a unique `deleted_classes` migration; an
environment migration array overrides the root array. The
[container deploy guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/guides/deploy/) says the
Worker becomes active before container configuration is processed and the deployment is not
transactional. The
[Wrangler container commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/containers/)
define `containers delete` as application deletion, while image deletion is a separate command.
Pinned Wrangler 4.114.0's `deployContainers` path only creates or updates applications that remain
in configuration, so omission does not establish application deletion; `deleteCommand` invokes
`ApplicationsService.deleteApplication` explicitly. Its generated application-list client uses
`GET /containers/dash/applications`, sends `page_token`, and returns
`result_info.next_page_token`; the JSON CLI path consumes only one such page. The CD helper uses the
same pinned API contract with the existing account and bearer-token authority, following each
non-empty cursor to a bounded exhaustion before it can prove absence. CD therefore deletes the old
application while the old class still exists, before it deploys the binding/code removal and class
deletion. It does not delete registry images or touch the agent container application.

A historical selected snapshot that still declares the migrator container skips this retirement,
retains its optional migrator image identity and is verified by the historical receipt shape. A new
snapshot contains only the agent image and requires an empty migrator container observation. The
post-merge staging receipt is the first platform proof of the final state; unit and dry-run tests are
not substitutes for it.

```

The hybrid topology runs the edge Worker plus the catalog and users Workers. The main `seichijunrei` Worker
(`workers/edge/src/entry.ts`) routes `/catalog/*` to the separate `catalog` Worker
(`workers/catalog/wrangler.toml`) via a wrangler service binding (`env.CATALOG.fetch`).
The Python agent in the container cannot use that JS-only binding, so it reaches
the catalog over the public origin: `CATALOG_API_URL` (forwarded into the
container as a plain var) points at the deployed host, and `CatalogClient` POSTs
to `{CATALOG_API_URL}/catalog/<method>`, which the main Worker forwards to the
catalog Worker. Deploy order: catalog Worker first (so `service = "catalog"`
resolves), then the main Worker.

Catalog and users Workers query Neon through Drizzle's `neon-http` driver, which supplies their
runtime query/type metadata. The checked-in Atlas directory is the only Neon schema authority for
all three. See
[`migrations.md`](./migrations.md) before changing a table or deploy step.

Agent HTTP surface (paths relative to `apps/agent/src/animichi/`):

- `interfaces/fastapi_service.py` / `interfaces/routes/health.py` — `GET /healthz`
- `interfaces/routes/runtime.py` — `POST /v1/runtime` and `POST /v1/runtime/stream` (SSE)
- `apps/agent/Dockerfile` packages the agent into a single container image

The deployment target stays intentionally thin. The Worker owns routing and edge auth; the container runs the agent service and stays unaware of raw end-user credentials.

## Trust Boundaries

| Layer | Responsibility | Secrets/config it should see |
|---|---|---|
| Web app (`apps/web`) | SSR browser surface, deployed as its own Worker on its own route | none of this Worker's secrets |
| Worker edge | Route match, JWT auth, identity injection | `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` |
| Container runtime | Backend service, DB, model/provider calls | `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL`, `MIMO_API_KEY`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, optional observability keys |

Current hardening rule: the Worker strips the raw `Authorization` header before proxying and forwards only trusted `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Type` identity headers to the container.

## Auth Flow

Worker auth is implemented in `workers/edge/src/identity/auth.ts`:

- JWT flow: `authenticate()` verifies the token signature locally against the branch's Neon Auth JWKS (jose `createRemoteJWKSet`, cached per isolate) — no per-request round-trip to the auth origin. AUTH-2 #950 hard cut: `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` is the edge's ONLY identity source; issuer/audience are derived from it (EdDSA), and the injected `X-User-Id` is the token `sub`.
- Production JWKS is unset — the production edge Worker fails closed on any bearer until its Neon Auth branch is provisioned.
- `sk_*` API keys are gone (AUTH-1 #945): an `sk_*` Bearer token is rejected as invalid — there is no `api_keys` lookup and no "agent" identity class.
- Forwarding flow: the Worker injects `X-User-Id` and `X-User-Type`, deletes `Authorization`, and proxies the request to `CONTAINER` (unchanged); `/v1/users/*` goes to the `USERS` service binding with the same identity headers (users trusts only the edge-forwarded identity).

Auth expectations:

- `/v1/*` always requires `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- `/healthz` and static assets bypass auth
- the container trusts only the Worker-injected identity headers; it is not the auth enforcement point

## Local Service Run

Install dependencies and start the service:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
make serve
```

Default bind settings:

- `SERVICE_HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `SERVICE_PORT=8080`

## Environment by Boundary

### Worker edge

Required at deploy time:

- `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` (staging; production unset — fails closed until its Neon Auth branch is provisioned)

These secrets stay in the Worker environment and are not forwarded into the container runtime. The edge JWT path verifies against the branch's public JWKS — no Supabase/anon key is involved (AUTH-2 #950).

### Container runtime

Required:

- `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` — the Postgres DSN (#995: the `SUPABASE_DB_URL` fallback
  was deleted from settings). The role-scoped Neon DSN (`agent_svc` role) is supplied
  via the edge Worker's Secrets Store binding and forwarded into the container. The legacy
  `SUPABASE_DB_URL` name remains only as a **transitional container-DSN env name** (a Neon DSN,
  not a live Supabase plane) pending the #855 rename; see `docs/ops/prod-dsn-cutover.md`.
- `MIMO_API_KEY` for the primary `mimo-v2.5` model — the runtime is MiMo-only (owner decision
  2026-09-15): no DeepSeek secret is required, provisioned, bound, or forwarded
- `APP_ENV` — forwarded from `wrangler.toml`'s per-environment `[vars]` block (`development` /
  `staging` / `production`), NOT a GitHub secret. Fail-closed since issue #498: the Worker throws at
  container-start if it is missing rather than seeding a hardcoded default, because a silent default
  previously tagged every environment's Logfire traces as `production` regardless of which
  environment actually deployed them.

  **There is a second, unrelated `APP_ENV`** — `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`'s per-env `vars`, read by
  `apps/web/src/server/noindex-plugin.ts`. Same name, same meaning, **opposite behaviour when
  absent**: the container's is fail-**closed** (throw), the web app's is fail-**open-to-noindex**
  (assume non-production and send `X-Robots-Tag`). Both directions are deliberate — a mislabelled
  trace is cheap, a live site that stops sending `noindex` is not, and neither is a live site that
  starts. Do not "unify" them without deciding which cost you are choosing. Guarded by
  `apps/web/tests/unit/wrangler-app-env.test.ts`, which also pins the top-level block: its `name` is
  the production Worker, so a `wrangler deploy` without `--env` would otherwise publish to
  production with no `APP_ENV` and silently deindex the site.

- `EDGE_SHOWCASE_MODE` — edge-only `[vars]` (NOT forwarded to the container, NOT a GitHub secret),
  the worker-side half of "prod is a landing-only showcase" (GOAL C): `"true"` (production) makes
  every functional route (`/v1/*`, `/v1/users/*`, the public catalog read) answer 403
  `showcase_denied` before any binding is touched, while `/healthz`, `/img/*`, `/tiles/*` stay
  reachable. Strict boolean like `VITE_SHOWCASE_MODE`: only the literal `"false"` opens the
  backend — unset/empty/malformed values fail closed (deny) with a one-per-isolate warning. Pinned
  by `workers/edge/test/container-env.test.ts`. CD's `smoke` job is automatic but does not probe
  this: it asks staging for `/healthz` and the SSR shell, both of which stay reachable in showcase
  mode by design. Production's 403 is the owner's own check after a promotion.

Production runs **MiMo-only** (owner decision 2026-09-15): no DeepSeek secret is provisioned, bound,
or forwarded to the container, so `FALLBACK_AGENT_MODEL` stays empty. Wiring a DeepSeek fallback
back in means provisioning the credential and its binding again (the Python provider code remains).

Common runtime config:

- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`
- `DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL`
- `FALLBACK_AGENT_MODEL` (empty by default for MiMo-only operation)
- `LOG_LEVEL`
- `MAX_RETRIES`
- `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `OBSERVABILITY_SERVICE_NAME`
- `OBSERVABILITY_SERVICE_VERSION`
- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` (optional — tracing/metrics export to Logfire only when set). Since issue #498,
  production and staging each write to their own Logfire project (`animichi-prod` /
  `animichi-staging`) via **GitHub Environment-scoped secrets of the same name**
  (`LOGFIRE_TOKEN` defined directly on the `production` and `staging` GitHub Environments), not
  via workflow-level branching. Staging promotion and the single production promotion both run
  under their job-level `environment:`, and GitHub environment secrets take precedence over a same-named secret the
  caller workflow explicitly passes through `secrets:` for a job that references that environment
  — see [Reuse workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows)
  ("If you include environment in the reusable workflow at the job level, the environment secret
  will be used, and not the secret passed from the caller workflow"). This was confirmed empirically
  against this repo's real GitHub Actions runners with a throwaway diagnostic workflow (three
  differently-sized marker secrets — repo-level, `production`-environment, `staging`-environment —
  each job resolved the environment-scoped one, not the repo-level one the caller passed): staging
  resolved the staging marker, production resolved the production marker, in both cases overriding
  what the caller's `secrets: LOGFIRE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LOGFIRE_TOKEN }}` line explicitly passed.
  The repo-level `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` secret remains only as the implicit fallback for a hypothetical
  environment with no `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` secret of its own (same convention already relied on for the
  8-9 other secrets — `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `NEON_DATABASE_URL`, `PULUMI_*`, `R2_*`,
  `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` — that are defined both at repo level and per-environment).
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` is defined as a **`production`-environment secret** (no repo-level copy) —
  by the same precedence rule above, it was already reaching the container correctly in production
  deploys. Staging gets its value a different way (#527/#528): `wrangler.toml`'s
  `[env.staging.vars].CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` sets it to the real staging web origin
  (`https://animichi-web-staging.zhenjiazhou0127.workers.dev`) as a plain (non-secret) value, not a
  GitHub secret — a domain name isn't a secret, and this needs no owner action to provision. Do
  **not** add a `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` secret to the `staging` GitHub Environment: it is no longer
  uploaded to the edge Worker: CD uploads no runtime secret at all since #1364, and the edge deploy
  step runs `wrangler deploy`, which leaves a secret its config does not declare alone. The eight edge
  runtime secrets are still the owner's `wrangler secret put` values until #1370 moves them into the
  Cloudflare Secrets Store — only `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` arrives through a
  `secrets_store_secrets` binding today ([`secrets.md`](./secrets.md) chains 1 and 2). So such a
  secret would be dead (unread), and if one of that name ever reached the Worker, it would silently
  override the wrangler var, reintroducing a second source of truth. Before #527/#528, staging had
  neither the secret nor the var, and inherited APP_ENV's mislabeling as "production" (see above) —
  which made `cors_allowed_origin`'s `"*"` default fail the production-strictness CORS check and
  **crash the container at boot** rather than silently accept a wildcard origin; #527/#528 fixed this at the
  `wrangler.toml` layer, independent of the APP_ENV fix in this same issue.
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (optional)
- `ANON_DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD` (optional — the global anonymous daily-dollar circuit breaker, X4/#274; `0` disables it)
- `ANON_DAILY_MESSAGE_QUOTA` (optional — the per-identity anonymous daily message quota, S1.10/#282, a fairness/UX mechanism rather than a defense line; `0` or unset disables it, same convention as the budget ceiling above)

Session storage:

- the backend currently uses the in-memory session store only

## Container Path

Build the image locally:

```bash
docker build -t seichijunrei-runtime .
```

Run the image locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL \
  -e MIMO_API_KEY \
  -e CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN \
  seichijunrei-runtime
```

Smoke test:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/runtime \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-User-Id: local-dev' \
  -H 'X-User-Type: human' \
  -d '{"text":"从京都站出发去吹响的圣地"}'
```

Note: direct container access trusts forwarded identity headers. Bearer-token auth is enforced at the Worker edge, not inside the container process.

## Cloudflare Workers + Containers Path

Production runs on Cloudflare Workers + Containers (backed by a Durable Object container class).
`wrangler deploy` builds the image from `Dockerfile`, uploads it to Cloudflare's container registry, and wires it to `RuntimeContainer`.

Requirements:

- Wrangler 4+ (`[[containers]]` is ignored by Wrangler 3)
- GitHub Actions uses `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v4` with `wranglerVersion: "4.79.0"`
- This repo deploys from the checked-in `Dockerfile`; there is no GHCR handoff

Routing defined by `wrangler.toml`:

- `/v1/*` and `/healthz` run through the Worker and proxy to `CONTAINER`
- `/v1/users/*` goes to the `USERS` service binding, trusting only the edge-forwarded identity headers (it no longer verifies its own JWT — AUTH-2 #950)
- `/catalog/public/anime-overview/:id` is the one allowlisted anonymous catalog read
- `/img/*` runs through the Worker image proxy/cache
- everything else answers a JSON `404 not_found`

<!-- historical: retired in #537 -->
Issue #537 removed the bundled legacy static frontend and with it the `[assets]` binding: this
Worker has **no** HTML surface. `apps/web` (TanStack Start) deploys as its own Worker and owns
every page. Route ownership for the apex is declared in Pulumi (`infra/index.ts`, #541): until
`webRoutesEnabled` is on, the edge Worker may have no public hostname at all
(`workers_dev = false`). `apps/web` owns HTML on its Worker hostname; the edge Worker is API +
proxy only (`/v1/*`, `/healthz`, `/img/*`, `/tiles/*`, one public catalog read).

## Deploy Sequence

There is one workflow-backed deploy path: an artifact ID dispatch to `CD` on main — automatic for
each successful main push's own snapshot, manual for any other selected artifact. The builder never
deploys and tags never trigger deployment.

### Schema change policy

Neon migrations run from `migrations/neon/` before the Worker rollout, but the old container can
still serve traffic while that step is running. A destructive change can therefore briefly break
old code that still reads or writes the removed schema; the `route_anime` release, for example,
dropped `routes.bangumi_id` in the same release that changed the writer. For schema changes where
that overlap matters, use expand/contract: add the replacement first, deploy compatible readers
and writers, then remove the old column in a later release. Today’s infrequent, approval-gated
cadence keeps this window low-risk, but it does not make destructive same-release changes safe by
construction. The full authoring/apply boundary is [`migrations.md`](./migrations.md).

### Migration promotion

The selected artifact carries the complete committed `migrations/neon/` chain, `atlas.sum` and any
`STAGING_ONLY_BASELINE` marker. It also carries Prisma's unchanged `contract.json` and complete native
migration directory beside the migrator bundle. The controller checks every source byte against the
selected release commit; newer graph files cannot enter an older selected artifact.

The first authenticated `POST /preflight` sends `{expectedHead, atlasSum, stagingOnlyBaseline}` to the
already deployed #1575 endpoint. This Atlas-only read precedes every deployment mutation and rejects
an unknown or incompatible ledger. A missing endpoint requires authorized bootstrap CD.

After that check, CD publishes the selected migration executor only. An older executor cannot preview
native migration files it does not carry. Both `/healthz` identities must match: `bundleHead` for
Atlas and `prismaTarget` for the native contract. Then CD calls `/preflight` with `expectedPrismaRef`
read from the selected contract's `storageHash`. Public Prisma `executeMigrateShowPlan` reads the
actual marker and graph without applying DDL. Its configured `contractHash` is not proof of the
selected or installed target; the receipt uses the requested target, native path and live marker.
Application foundation changes and service publication occur only after this preview succeeds.

`scripts/delivery/migrate-through-worker.sh <environment>` sends the same sealed Atlas metadata and
Prisma ref to `/migrate` using the existing `animichi:github-actions:migrator` OIDC audience. Under the
fixed apply Durable Object lock, the endpoint revalidates both owners before DDL. Atlas applies only
its selected original chain; Prisma's public control client applies its selected snapshot and native
graph. Neither owner may alter the other's objects. Existing Atlas SQL remains immutable; Prisma owns
only the new agent contract tables. There is no cross-owner transaction: a later Prisma failure can
leave an already committed compatible Atlas prefix, and retry must revalidate that state.

The final read-only observation must show the exact selected Atlas head, Prisma target and installed
marker, with no pending migrations for either owner. Staging receipt verification compares that
native marker with the contract in the same selected artifact. A matching Atlas head alone cannot
approve promotion. SQL and secret failures return stable codes, never internal exception messages.

CD performs no staging baseline reset. Missing/empty/native-baseline state requires an explicit
bootstrap or recovery decision. Production's baseline marker guard runs before Pulumi and every
other mutation. The migrator binding, role and existing topology must be bootstrapped before selected
executor publication; selected-artifact deployment does not provision its own access prerequisites.
Staging and production retain separate DSN bindings and exact main-controller OIDC
policies. CI receives no database credential and does not run direct database migrations.

Expand/contract remains necessary: schema is applied before its consumers, and a Worker rollback
does not reverse migrations. Follow [migrations.md](migrations.md) and
[neon-backup-rpo.md](neon-backup-rpo.md) for provisioning or recovery.

### Read-only migration preflight (#1575)

The migrator exposes authenticated `POST /preflight` for the selected-artifact
controller. Its Atlas-only phase sends `{expectedHead, atlasSum, stagingOnlyBaseline}`
from its verified artifact, with a main-ref GitHub OIDC token for the existing
environment-selected migrator policy. `expectedHead` is the final filename without
`.sql`. That phase accepts a selected Atlas chain newer than its own bundle, reads the
complete revision ledger using native Neon `readOnly: true` / `RepeatableRead`, and
returns `200 {compatible:true, expectedHead, appliedHead, pendingCount}` only for a
completed matching prefix. Unknown metadata or database history fails closed.

An authenticated missing/empty ledger returns `422 ledger_missing` / `ledger_empty`;
partial history, hash divergence, native baseline/resolved rows, newer schema and a
production staging-only baseline flag also return stable refusals. Missing identity
is 401, disallowed identity 403, malformed metadata 400 (oversized input 413), and
secret/driver unavailability 503. Responses are `Cache-Control: no-store` and contain
no database credentials or driver messages. `/healthz` still describes the bundle.

Bootstrap must use the previous authorized main-push CD path before activating selected-artifact CD. Record the deployed
version, artifact identity, environment, request metadata digest and sanitized
HTTP status/body for a signed read-only call plus unauthenticated and wrong-environment
refusals. A state refusal is evidence of the endpoint and that state, not permission
to reset or apply. Record production observations separately after its environment
approval. These platform observations remain pending until actually performed.
#1564 must not activate while either target returns 404/unavailable; it must repeat
the comparison inside the existing apply lock before mutation. Preflight alone does
not protect against a later apply racing this snapshot. #1575 delivered that read-only endpoint;
#1564 adds the bounded apply metadata and actual lock-held revalidation described above.
Local code and database tests do not replace the pending live bootstrap observations.


### Select and promote (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)

1. Every successful `Release build` run on main dispatches `CD` for its own
   `release-snapshot-<sha>-<attempt>` artifact, so staging needs no manual action; the artifact ID
   and digest are still shown in that run's summary. Intermediate or old cohort artifacts are not
   eligible.
2. To deploy a different release instead — an older artifact, a re-deploy, a rollback — dispatch
   `CD` with `--ref main` and that `artifact_id`, for example
   `gh workflow run cd.yml --ref main -f artifact_id=<existing-id>`. The workflow verifies provenance
   and the complete snapshot before opening environment credentials.
3. Staging publishes the complete selected snapshot, smokes the edge and web workers.dev surfaces,
   and uploads an immutable receipt. Failure stops promotion.
4. Inspect that release's receipt before approving the actual `production` environment job. After
   approval the job re-downloads the same ID/digest, verifies the receipt, and checks production's
   current baseline, registry and ledger before any mutation. Production observes its own script-scoped
   version/deployment IDs and smokes `https://animichi.com` after publication.

Rejecting production affects that run only. It does not block another staging selection. Rerunning
uses the same selected artifact; if its artifact or receipt expired, select an available eligible
release explicitly. A new main push deploys its own correction to staging and still needs its own
production approval.

### Activation evidence required for #1564

The repository candidate is not platform readiness. Before enabling the new builder/controller:

- Bootstrap #1575's read-only migrator endpoint through authorized CD on each target environment;
  observe a signed read-only response and wrong-environment refusal. Verify apply-lock revalidation.
- Provision a main-only GitHub `release-build` environment and its exact native Pulumi issuer claim
  for `lifeodyssey/animichi/.github/workflows/release-build.yml@refs/heads/main`. Keep deployment
  identities on the existing exact `cd.yml` path; never add a wildcard or reuse staging's subject.
- Provision the build registry configuration and credential; demonstrate real pushed manifest
  digests and read access from both deployment environments. #1565 owns provider-enforced principal
  separation and sibling-ESC denial; export filtering does not establish that boundary.
- Complete runtime-secret/foundation provisioning, approved production baseline cutover and
  production hostname/routing readiness. The current committed production topology leaves apex
  activation off, so the production smoke URL is an explicit readiness prerequisite.
- Run real harmless cross-run artifact/digest substitution probes, concurrent environment lock
  and approval probes, and record per-environment Worker/container/schema/smoke identities.

No local test or dry run substitutes for these observations, and none authorizes local deployment,
production approval, secret mutation or baseline reset.

### Pulumi state, encryption, and CI identity (#1077, #1078, #1367)

Both Pulumi projects — `seichijunrei-infra` (`infra/`) and `animichi-neon-secrets`
(`infra/database-access/`) — keep their state and their `secure:` encryption in **Pulumi Cloud**,
organization `lifeodyssey`. `backend.url` in each `Pulumi.yaml` is the source of truth for that.

CI obtains short-lived Pulumi credentials through native GitHub OIDC, then opens ESC configuration.
It does not read repository/environment GitHub secrets. The selected controller uses these mappings:

| Responsibility | GitHub environment | ESC environment | Pulumi stacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build | `release-build` | `lifeodyssey/animichi/release-build` | none |
| Staging chain | `staging` | `lifeodyssey/animichi/staging` | `lifeodyssey/staging` in both projects |
| Production chain | `production` | `lifeodyssey/animichi/prod` | `lifeodyssey/prod` in both projects |

`pulumi/auth-actions` retains the existing personal token type and `scope: user:lifeodyssey`.
That account model does not prove per-role authorization. #1565 requires provider-side boundaries
and actual sibling-environment denial; neither an ESC export list nor a shell wrapper supplies them.
The new build environment/issuer permission is a platform activation prerequisite, not an existing
staging credential reused under a different label.

Build exports `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for registry publication. Deployment exports the Cloudflare
credential for native Wrangler and Pulumi. Staging additionally exports its Access service-token
pair for smoke. CD no longer exports `NEON_API_KEY` or resets staging; the Neon provider reads its
encrypted stack configuration. Runtime values belong in Secrets Store through Pulumi, subject to
#1370's required provisioning, and must not be copied into artifact or job outputs.

Each ESC opening is followed by a nonempty-value check because the action otherwise only warns.
Its Pulumi CLI version is explicitly pinned. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is a repository variable, not
a secret. Registry login uses a private runner directory and short-lived native Wrangler credentials;
consumers request pull permission and validate real Docker manifest/configuration responses.

Applies stay organization-qualified and use the sealed foundation sources/dependencies.
`PULUMI_BACKEND_URL`, passphrase and R2 state keys are absent from the delivery lane. The old state
migration below is historical owner work and is not a step of selected-artifact deployment.

#### One-time migration (owner, once per stack)

Agents do not run this — it needs the passphrase and an interactive Pulumi Cloud login. Run it once
per stack, from the project directory, with the campaign paused (no `main` push mid-flight).

Stacks to move: `seichijunrei-infra/staging`, `seichijunrei-infra/prod`,
`animichi-neon-secrets/staging`, `animichi-neon-secrets/prod`.

```bash
cd infra                     # or: cd infra/database-access

# 1. Export from the retiring R2 backend, using the passphrase that still owns the ciphertext.
#    The explicit `pulumi login` matters: after you have done step 2 for an earlier stack, the
#    CLI's stored login points at Pulumi Cloud, and this is what re-points it at R2. It is also
#    exactly what the retired CD code did before every apply.
#    The two secret values are read with `read -r -s` instead of being typed into an `export`:
#    an inline assignment lands the value in the shell history file and, briefly, in the process
#    list. `-s` also keeps it off the terminal. Reading them from a mode-600 file works too.
export PULUMI_BACKEND_URL='<the retiring s3:// R2 backend URL>'
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<R2 state key id>'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=auto
read -r -s -p 'Pulumi config passphrase: ' PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE && echo
read -r -s -p 'R2 state secret: ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY && echo
export PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
pulumi login "$PULUMI_BACKEND_URL"
pulumi stack select <stack>
pulumi stack export --file "/tmp/$(basename "$PWD")-<stack>.json"   # no --show-secrets, ever

# 2. Log into Pulumi Cloud and create the destination stack under the org. PULUMI_BACKEND_URL
#    must be unset first: it takes precedence over both the stored login and Pulumi.yaml's
#    backend.url (measured on Pulumi 3.255.0, the version .pulumi.version pins).
unset PULUMI_BACKEND_URL AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
pulumi login                                        # https://api.pulumi.com
pulumi stack init lifeodyssey/<stack>

# 3. Import the checkpoint, then re-encrypt the stack's `secure:` values under Pulumi Cloud's
#    provider. change-secrets-provider needs the OLD passphrase to read the existing ciphertext,
#    so keep PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE exported until this command has succeeded.
pulumi stack import --file "/tmp/$(basename "$PWD")-<stack>.json" --stack lifeodyssey/<stack>
pulumi stack change-secrets-provider default --stack lifeodyssey/<stack>
unset PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE

# 4. Verify: a clean preview against Pulumi Cloud with no passphrase in the environment.
pulumi preview --stack lifeodyssey/<stack>
```

Step 3 rewrites `Pulumi.<stack>.yaml` in the working tree — the `encryptionsalt` line disappears and
each `secure:` value is replaced by Pulumi Cloud ciphertext. Commit those four files as a normal
reviewed change. `infra/database-access/Pulumi.prod.yaml` has no encrypted material today, so its
`change-secrets-provider` is a no-op; run it anyway so all four stacks end on the same provider.

Until every stack is imported, the rollback path is the old one: re-point `PULUMI_BACKEND_URL` at
R2 and restore the export taken in step 1. After the cutover, rollback is Pulumi Cloud history.
Deleting the GitHub secrets themselves is the owner's step in #1367 (#1081), taken after one green
staging deploy and one green nightly on the ESC path — deleting `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` is what closes this rollback window for good.

## Staging access (Cloudflare Access, D3 #1369)

Staging runs the same app as production **with anonymous access on**, so there is no login of
its own keeping strangers out. Cloudflare Access is that login: humans sign in against an
identity policy, automation presents a **service token**, and both are decided by Cloudflare
before a request reaches the Worker.

`infra/src/staging-access.ts` declares the token, the application and both policies on the
staging stack, and reads — never declares — the account's identity provider:

- one `ZeroTrustAccessApplication` (`type: "self_hosted"`, `sessionDuration: "24h"`,
  `appLauncherVisible: false`) whose `destinations` are the three hostnames staging answers on:
  `staging.animichi.com` and the `animichi-staging` / `animichi-web-staging` workers.dev
  origins. All three, because CD's smoke probe deliberately uses the workers.dev origins —
  GitHub-runner IPs get a managed challenge at the zone front door — and a staging surface CI
  can reach that Access cannot see is the hole (#539) this closes;
- a `non_identity` (**Service Auth**) policy including the service token, first in precedence.
  Service Auth is the only decision that answers a service token; under a plain `allow` the CD
  probe is redirected to an identity provider and reads the login page as a broken deploy;
- an `allow` policy with one include rule per address in the `stagingAccessAllowedEmails` stack
  config (`infra/Pulumi.staging.yaml`) — plain config, because it says who may sign in, not how.
  An empty list is refused at build time: it would be a door no human can open;
- the account's `onetimepin` identity provider, **read and named** on the application as its
  only `allowedIdps` entry — `infra/src/access-identity-provider.ts` looks it up with the
  `getZeroTrustAccessIdentityProviders` data source and refuses to build unless the account
  reports exactly one. **The human login path is therefore an emailed one-time PIN** to an
  address in the allowlist — no password, no third-party app registration. It is named rather
  than defaulted because `allowedIdps` left out means "all IdPs configured in your account",
  which would widen who is offered a login box the day the account grows a provider.
  **It is an ACCOUNT-level object that this stack references and does not own.** Cloudflare
  allows exactly one One-time PIN provider per account and this account already had one, made
  for another project's Access application: the earlier revision that declared it here was
  answered `POST /accounts/{id}/access/identity_providers 409 Conflict` in `stage-foundation`.
  What justified that declaration was a read answering `[]` on 2026-09-08 — the response
  Cloudflare gives (`200`, never `403`) to a token lacking *Access: Organizations, Identity
  Providers, and Groups Read*, indistinguishable from an account with no login methods. **If the
  apply now fails saying the account reports no `onetimepin` provider, check that permission on
  the Cloudflare API token before creating anything**; if it genuinely has none, create the
  One-time PIN login method once under Zero Trust → Settings → Authentication;
- the `animichi-staging-ci` `ZeroTrustAccessServiceToken` (duration `8760h`) and two stack
  outputs:

| Stack output | ESC key in `lifeodyssey/animichi/staging` | Request header |
|---|---|---|
| `stagingAccessClientId` | `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` (`environmentVariables`) | `CF-Access-Client-Id` |
| `stagingAccessClientSecret` | `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` (`environmentVariables`) | `CF-Access-Client-Secret` |

**That token expires after one year** and nothing alerts on it — the deadline, the two renewal
paths and who is (not) warned are in `secrets.md`, "It expires. Nothing tells you."

The ESC environment imports the two outputs through its `pulumi-stacks` provider, so no value is
copied by hand. Renaming either output empties the ESC key silently —
`infra/topology-staging-access.test.ts` pins both names for exactly that reason. Production has
none of this: it has a real login, and `infra/topology-prod.test.ts` pins that no application,
policy or token is built there.

Every automated caller sends the pair when both variables are set, and refuses when exactly one
is: the CD smoke probe (`.github/scripts/staging-smoke-check.sh`), the Playwright suite
(`e2e/playwright.config.ts`, `use.extraHTTPHeaders`), the staging lanes
(`workers/edge/api-test/lane-origin.ts`). The retired HTTP Eval launcher no longer uses this door;
the native Eval task runs in process. The names and the refusal live once, in
`packages/contract/src/access-service-token.ts`. Access answers a
request carrying one header exactly as it answers one carrying neither — a 302 to the login page
— so a half-declared token would surface as "the app is broken", which is why it fails closed by
name instead.

**Enforcement is eventually consistent.** An Access application starts refusing traffic a minute
or two after the apply, not at the apply. On the run that first creates it, the foundation apply
and `staging smoke` are minutes apart in the same job, so that smoke can pass without ever having
been checked — the evidence that the door is live is the NEXT push's smoke, plus a `curl` with no
headers answering 302 or 403.

**What this replaced.** A WAF custom rule blocking traffic without an allowlisted source IP, the
`animichi_staging` cookie or the `x-staging-key` header, plus a hand-written OIDC exchange in the
edge Worker. Both are deleted (#1369): `infra/src/staging.ts`'s ruleset,
`workers/edge/src/staging-gate/**`, `scripts/setup-staging-gate.sh`, `e2e/global-setup.ts`, the
`stagingGate*` / `stagingAllowedIps` stack config and the `STAGING_GATE_TOKEN` GitHub secret. A
WAF rule can only see hostnames on the zone, and its credential was a static string that had to
stay in sync across a stack config and a GitHub secret. `infra/src/staging.ts` keeps only
`staging-http-config-settings`, which turns the Browser Integrity Check and the security-level
challenge off for the staging hostname so CI is not challenged ahead of Access.

**Locally.** Read the values from ESC rather than a file:

```sh
esc env open lifeodyssey/animichi/staging environmentVariables.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID --format string
esc env open lifeodyssey/animichi/staging environmentVariables.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET --format string
```

`open` and not `get`: `get` prints the environment's *definition*, which for these two keys is
the `pulumi-stacks` import expression rather than the resolved value (and, for a static secret,
ciphertext unless `--show-secrets` is passed). So
`esc env get lifeodyssey/animichi/staging environmentVariables` is what to run when you only need
to see that the two keys are declared and where they come from — it shows the import expression,
never the token.

A browser needs no variables at all: open `https://staging.animichi.com/`, enter an address in
`stagingAccessAllowedEmails`, paste the one-time PIN Cloudflare emails to it, and the session
lasts 24 hours.

## WAF and Edge Hardening

Manual Cloudflare dashboard steps live in `docs/ops/cloudflare-hardening.md`.
That runbook covers:

- `/v1/*` rate limiting
- coarse prompt-injection WAF filters
- rollback steps for over-blocking rules
- the future AI Gateway insertion point

The edge's layered rate-limit rollback procedure (native vs durable tiers, and
the rate-policy decision table) is `docs/ops/rate-limit-rollback.md`; it belongs
next to any `/v1/*`-rate-limiting incident run.

## AI Gateway Insertion Path

If AI Gateway is enabled later, it belongs between the container and the upstream model provider.
It does not belong in the browser and does not belong in the Worker.

Planned env design:

- `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_URL` as an optional container-only env

Important: this is a documentation target only right now. Before enabling it, the backend planner client must support provider base-URL override through env rather than assuming the provider default.

## Rollback

Rollback is incident recovery, not a second deployment path. There is no rollback workflow: the
hand-written one was deleted with #1364 because Cloudflare already keeps every published version.
Recovery is `wrangler rollback`, run by the owner from a laptop, against one Worker at a time. No
workflow and no agent runs it — `CD` only ever moves forward (spec §二).

### The five Workers, by environment

| unit | staging Worker | production Worker |
|---|---|---|
| catalog | `catalog-staging` | `catalog` |
| users | `users-staging` | `users` |
| migrator | `migrator-staging` | added by #1365 (`workers/migrator/wrangler.toml` has no `[env.production]` before it) |
| edge (carries the agent container image) | `animichi-staging` | `animichi` |
| web (SSR) | `animichi-web-staging` | `animichi-web` |

The names are `[env.<stage>].name` in `workers/catalog/wrangler.toml`, `workers/users/wrangler.toml`,
`workers/migrator/wrangler.toml`, `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` and `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`.
`wrangler rollback` addresses the deployed Worker by name, so always pass `--name` rather than
relying on a config file and `--env`.

### 1. Find the version

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler versions list --name <worker>
```

It prints the **10 most recent** versions with their `Version ID`, `Created`, and `Tag`. From #1364
on, every `CD` deploy tags the version it publishes `sha-<sha>`, so the tag is the commit the
version was built from: pick the last version whose tag is a commit you trust. Versions published
before that card carry `Tag: -` and are only identifiable by timestamp.

The rollback window is wider than the listing. Cloudflare: "You can only roll back to the 100 most
recently published versions", and "When using Wrangler in interactive mode, you can select from up
to 100 recent versions"
([rollbacks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/rollbacks/)).
So for anything older than the 10 the CLI prints, run `wrangler rollback --name <worker>` with no
version id and pick from the interactive list, or read the ids off **Workers & Pages → your Worker →
Deployments** in the dashboard. The listing window slides with every deploy — measured on
`catalog-staging` on 2026-09-07, one new deploy moved the earliest listable version from
`2026-09-06T15:40:27Z` to `2026-09-06T18:54:36Z` — so "not in `versions list`" does not mean "cannot
roll back to".

### 2. Roll back

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler rollback <version-id> --name <worker> -y --message "<why>"
```

`--message` is the incident record; wrangler's prompt caps it at 120 characters ("Please provide an
optional message for this rollback (120 characters max)"). The Cloudflare docs say that specifying it
skips both the confirmation and the message prompt, and they do not list `-y` among `rollback`'s
options at all — wrangler 4.114.0 nonetheless accepts `-y, --yes` (`wrangler rollback --help`). What
the drill below actually captured, with `-y --message` on both runs: the message prompt still printed
once, on the roll-back run, and resolved itself ("Using default value in non-interactive context:
…"); the confirmation prompt still printed once, on the roll-forward run, and the command completed
without waiting. Pass both flags — between the two of them nothing in either run needed a terminal.
Omitting `<version-id>` rolls back to "the version uploaded before the latest version"
([wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#rollback)), which is
the usual incident case, but naming the id is what makes the step reviewable afterwards.

### 3. Verify

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler deployments list --name <worker>
```

The newest entry is last: it carries your `--message` and `(100%) <version-id>`. A rollback creates a
new **deployment**, not a new version — `versions list` is byte-for-byte unchanged after one, so
never verify a rollback with `versions list` alone.

Then check health on a route that actually exists for that Worker:

- edge: `https://animichi-staging.zhenjiazhou0127.workers.dev/healthz` — the same URL `CD`'s
  `staging smoke` step probes.
- web: `https://animichi-web-staging.zhenjiazhou0127.workers.dev/` — the SSR shell, that step's
  second probe.
- migrator: `GET $MIGRATOR_STAGING_URL/healthz` (the workflow variable of that name). It answers
  `{status, service, env, bundleHead, prismaTarget}` from the chain and native contract carried by
  `workers/migrator/src/create-app.ts`.
- catalog and users: **no public host** — both configs set `workers_dev = false` and are reached only
  through the edge's service bindings. Verify them with `deployments list` plus a request through the
  edge (`/catalog/public/anime-overview/:id` for catalog, an authenticated `/v1/users/*` call for
  users). A probe of `catalog-staging.<subdomain>.workers.dev/healthz` returns 404 no matter which
  version is deployed; that 404 is the absent host, not a failed rollback.

### 4. Roll forward

The same command with the newer version id. There is no separate "undo": rolling forward is a
rollback to a later version, and it appends another deployment with its own message.

### What a rollback does and does not restore

A version "captures the complete state of your Worker at a point in time: its bundled code, static
assets, bindings, and compatibility settings"
([versions & deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/)), so
the target version's binding declarations return with its code. What does not return is the state
behind them: "Resources connected to your Worker will not be changed during a rollback", and "State
changes for associated storage resources such as KV, R2, Durable Objects, and D1 are not tracked with
versions". Concretely, a rollback does not:

- reverse an applied Neon migration — schema promotion precedes consumers, which is why
  expand/contract is mandatory (see "Migration promotion" above);
- undo a Durable Object class lifecycle change. Cloudflare **refuses** the rollback outright when a
  DO class lifecycle change (via exports or the legacy `migrations` array) happened between the
  active version and the target, or when the target has a binding to an R2 bucket, KV namespace, or
  queue that no longer exists. Plan a code fix forward for those, not a rollback;
- restore Pulumi state (see the Pulumi paragraph below);
- change the container image on its own: a rolled-back edge Worker references the image its version's
  config named, so the agent tier follows the Worker version;
- rewind a secret. Values behind Secrets Store bindings are read live, and the version records only
  the binding. "`wrangler secret put` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately"
  ([secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/)), so a rotation is
  itself a version; what a rollback across one does to the value is not documented and has not been
  exercised here.

Honest limit on the binding claim: it is Cloudflare's documentation, not our measurement. On
2026-09-07 the two most recent `catalog-staging` versions bound the same two Secrets Store entries
(`CATALOG_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `CATALOG_DATABASE_URL`) and the same two R2 buckets, and the last three
`animichi-web-staging` versions carried identical `APP_ENV` / `RUNTIME_CONFIG` vars — no deploy in
the window changed a binding, so a rollback *across* a binding change is still unexercised here
(spec §七 #15).

### Drill: 2026-09-07, `catalog-staging`

`catalog-staging` was serving `33fe9323-2261-466f-be22-2a66efa2ce57` (published 12:55:52Z by `CD`).

1. `wrangler rollback d4e2e9d7-2d2e-4dd7-9b26-90d0877dcfbf --name catalog-staging -y --message "C4
   drill: roll back one version"` → deployment at 14:36:35Z, `(100%) d4e2e9d7…`, message recorded.
2. `wrangler deployments list --name catalog-staging` → newest entry is that deployment;
   `versions list` still returned the same 10 versions.
3. Roll forward with the same command and `33fe9323-2261-466f-be22-2a66efa2ce57` → `SUCCESS Worker
   Version 33fe9323… has been deployed to 100% of traffic`, deployment at 14:37:02Z with message
   "C4 drill: roll forward".

Elapsed: 27 seconds from rollback to roll-forward. The drill also produced the 404 caveat above — the
health probe used, `catalog-staging.zhenjiazhou0127.workers.dev/healthz`, 404s in both states because
catalog has no public host, which is why this runbook names the edge and web URLs instead.

### After any recovery

Release artifacts are retained for 14 days. If the selected artifact has expired, land a reviewed
revert on `main` and let `release-build.yml` publish a new immutable artifact, which dispatches `CD`
for itself; promote that run through the production approval. Revert the bad change on `main` so the
next release restores trunk state — a rolled-back Worker is behind `main` until you do.

For Pulumi, inspect the failed update in Pulumi Cloud's stack history and roll back from there: read
the last-good version number out of `pulumi stack history`, then `pulumi stack export --version
<version> --file state.json` and `pulumi stack import --file state.json`. A bare `pulumi stack
export` writes the *latest* checkpoint, which after a failed update is the broken one, so the version
is not optional. Follow the import with a reviewed reconciliation — the pre-apply R2 export is
retired (#1077). Never place a state export in a public GitHub artifact.

`CD`'s own `Smoke the release` step does not run on a recovery, so the owner must manually check health and the
affected user journey after one.

## Known Limitations

- default session storage is in-memory unless a distributed backend is introduced later
- OpenTelemetry exporters are opt-in and disabled by default
- AI Gateway is documented but not yet wired in backend provider configuration
- Release identity is the selected native artifact ID and `artifact-digest`, bound to its repository,
  build run and source SHA; the artifact name is a label. Before deployment credentials, the current
  accepted-main controller verifies the official download digest, sealed manifest, file hashes and
  complete source closure. Staging and production consume that same ID/digest and record their own
  script-scoped runtime identities. Health metadata supports diagnosis; it does not replace these checks.

## HISTORICAL (pre-2026-07): feat/ssr-cloudflare Post-deploy Notes

This section records the old feat/ssr-cloudflare merge runbook. It is not the current deployment
trigger or an executable migration procedure. **Historical only; no longer current.** The current
Neon migration authority is `migrations/neon/` applied by pinned Atlas before the Worker rollout;
use [`migrations.md`](./migrations.md) and the workflow paths above instead.

After the old feat/ssr-cloudflare merge, operators used these checks:

1. **Historical Supabase schema event (not a current apply)** — the old Supabase CLI path recorded
   these legacy schema files:
   - `20260509200000_fix_wrong_bangumi_ids.sql` — delete wrong seed IDs
   - `20260510170000_add_bangumi_platform.sql` — add platform column
   - `20260510180000_add_points_city.sql` — add city column to points

2. **Backfill city for existing points** — one-time, run after migrations:
   ```bash
   AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL=<production_dsn> uv run python -m backend.scripts.backfill_city
   ```
   This reverse-geocodes all points with `city IS NULL` using GeoNames data (~12MB).
   Expected: ~1000+ points across ~50 cities. Takes <30 seconds.

3. **Verify** — check a few bangumi:
   ```sql
