# Local Gates — three hook stages over the affected packages

CI is the terminal gate; the local gates exist so a red push is the exception. What they gate is
decided by the changed files alone, and what they run for a package is that package's own
`package.json` scripts — the same scripts CI's affected matrix runs. There is no second gate
definition to drift from, so nothing has to prove local and CI agree (#1371).

## Principles

1. **The changed files decide.** pre-commit reads the **staged** diff; pre-push reads
   **merge-base-to-head**. Only what changed is gated.
2. **A package's gates are its own scripts.** `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:integration` in that
   package's `package.json` (#1358). Coverage floors and drift checks live inside them, so the hook
   never carries a weaker copy. One suite is deliberately kept out: the catalog spike boots a Docker
   Postgres container, and chaining it into `test` started that container on every catalog push
   (#1473, the #1322 flake class), so `test:spike` is a script of its own that CI's `catalog` lane
   and `make check-full` run. `test/repo-config/package-test-segments.test.rb` pins the arrangement
   from three ends: `test` must not chain it, the workflow and the `Makefile` must each name
   `pnpm --filter catalog run test:spike`, and that script must still run `vitest.spike.config.ts`.
3. **Fail closed on the unknown.** A changed path that maps to no package, no bucket and no
   whitelist entry fails the push and is named in the output. Silence is never the answer.
4. **No suppressions.** Fix the failing gate or triage it explicitly; `--no-verify` is a policy
   violation (CI still enforces).
5. **No cloud mutation, no local deploy.** No hook runs a mutating `pulumi up/destroy`,
   `wrangler deploy` (only `--dry-run`, inside a package's own script), or `atlas migrate apply`
   outside a disposable local container.

Install all three stages from the repository root:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```

## pre-commit (universal + staged packages, <10s)

- `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `check-toml`
- `check-executables-have-shebangs` + `check-shebang-scripts-are-executable` — the two halves of the
  shebang/exec-bit agreement, upstream's implementation of what a local script used to hand-roll
- `gitleaks` (secret scan)
- `shellcheck --severity=warning` over **every** shell file in the repository
- `actionlint` over `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}`
- `ruff --fix` + `ruff-format` over all repository Python
- `semgrep` over the repository's own six ORM-boundary rules (`.semgrep/`)
- `oxlint --type-aware --deny-warnings` for the staged workspace packages, dispatched by
  `scripts/local-gates/oxlint-changed.sh`

## commit-msg (history hygiene, sub-second)

`commitlint` against `commitlint.config.js` — the one validator. CI's `commits` job runs the same
file over the pull request's commits and over its title (GitHub uses the PR title as the squashed
subject on `main`), so a subject that passes locally passes there. It rejects unknown types and
scopes, subjects over 72 characters, generic outcomes (`wip`, `checkpoint`, `update`, …), a subject
that starts with anything but a lowercase verb, an issue reference in the subject, and
Claude/Anthropic/Codex/OpenAI `Co-Authored-By` or `Generated with` trailers. Legitimate human and
Dependabot co-authors survive, and `Merge …` / `Revert "…"` subjects are exempt. Body and footer
lines over 100 characters are rejected too — that pair comes from `@commitlint/config-conventional`,
which the config extends, not from a rule written here.

Two ways to check a message without committing:

```bash
pnpm install                              # the hook brings its own CLI; this one is yours
pnpm exec commitlint --edit path/to/draft # one drafted message
pnpm exec commitlint --from origin/main   # every commit on the branch
```

**Not** `pre-commit run commitlint --hook-stage commit-msg`. The upstream hook is
`entry: commitlint --edit` with `pass_filenames: false`, so pre-commit discards the value of the
`--commit-msg-filename` it nonetheless demands, and commitlint always lints whatever sits in
`$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/COMMIT_EDITMSG`. Aimed at a file holding `wip` while `COMMIT_EDITMSG`
held a valid subject, it reports Passed — that run says nothing about the file you named.

## pre-push (`scripts/local-gates/pre-push-affected.sh`)

One hook — over the ≤40 the card asked for, and the reason is written into the script:
reading the pushed refs (below) and checking every path for an owner both take real code, and
shrinking them back would mean deleting a guard rather than tightening one.

**What is gated is `HEAD`'s diff, and the pushed refs are read to prove that is the right thing to
gate.** git hands a pre-push hook one `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>` record per
ref on stdin. The script reads those records, skips deletions (a zero local sha), and refuses any
whose local sha is not `HEAD`:

```text
pre-push: refs must be pushed from their own worktree (HEAD is <sha>, pushing <ref>@<sha>)
```

Gating such a push would be theatre: the changed paths would come from the pushed ref while
`pnpm ls` and every package script ran against the checked-out tree, so a broken change could pass
on another branch's green. Running the pushed ref's own suites would mean checking it out, which a
push hook has no business doing. This repository is one worktree per card, so `git push` from the
worktree that owns the branch — which is the only way anyone works here — never meets the rule.
Push `other` by checking `other` out.

`HEAD`'s diff is taken against its merge base with `origin/main`, or against the remote sha when
that is already an ancestor of `HEAD`, which narrows it to what the remote has not seen.

pre-commit's pre-push wrapper consumes that stdin itself and re-exports the first pushable record
as `PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF` / `PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF` (`pre_commit/commands/hook_impl.py`,
`_pre_push_ns`), so the script reads stdin when it is given any and falls back to those variables —
which is what keeps the refusal working under the wrapper too. For an ordinary push both name
`HEAD` and nothing is refused.

`pnpm ls -r --depth -1 --json` lists the workspace project directories; a prefix join against the
changed paths gives the package set. The root project and `@animichi/agent-python` are dropped — the first
would match every file by directory containment, the second is the agent bucket's job. Each selected
package then runs, through `pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=1 --filter "...<name>" run --if-present`:

```text
lint → typecheck → test → test:integration
```

`...<name>` pulls in that package's dependents, so a `packages/contract` change gates its consumers.
`--no-renames` lists both sides of a rename, so a cross-package move gates the source package too.

**One package at a time.** `pnpm -r run` defaults to a concurrency of 4 (`pnpm help recursive`, pnpm
10.33.2) and a `...<name>` closure is wide — `packages/contract` pulls in all eight TypeScript
packages — so the suites used to run side by side on one laptop: `apps/web`'s vitest run blew its
5 s budgets (#1503) and the e2e lane's webServer died mid-run with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, 16
failed, while that lane alone passed 43/43 in 34 s (#1369, #1517). That last lane is a fixed-resource
claimant no longer: since #1692 the emitted Worker's port is derived from the checkout running the
lane rather than hardcoded to `:8799` (`e2e/AGENTS.md` — `E2E_EMITTED_WORKER_PORT` pins it), so a
second worktree's lane is a second port instead of a claimant on this one. What is left is genuine
CPU and memory contention, which is why the serialization stays.
`--workspace-concurrency=1` keeps pnpm's topological order and runs one package at a time. It is set
on all four scripts and not on the suites alone: measured over the contract closure it cost `lint`
41 s against 32 s but ran `typecheck` in 15 s against 22 s (2026-09-08, 10 cores), so the
parallelism given up is a wash, and one form of the invocation is one fewer thing to keep true.
`make check-full` splits them only because it runs `pnpm -r` over every package unfiltered.

### Why the selection is git's and not pnpm's

pnpm has this exact selector — `--filter "...[<ref>]"` — and CI uses it. Locally we cannot: from a
linked git worktree **nested inside the repository** (`.worktrees/<card>/`, where every card is
developed) pnpm 10.33.2 answers `No projects matched the filters` and exits 0. `getChangedProjects`
resolves the repository root with `find.dir('.git')`, which walks up and finds the *parent* repo's
`.git` directory before the worktree's own `.git` file, so the changed paths are joined onto the
wrong repository root and match no project. Upstream issue: <https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/12626> (open).
Handing selection to pnpm here would be fail-open — a silent no-op gate — which is why the join is
done against `pnpm ls` output instead.

### The four buckets

Paths outside every pnpm project would otherwise be invisible to the join:

| Changed path | Bucket |
|---|---|
| `apps/agent/**` or `packages/contract/**` | `make check` — ruff + ruff-format + vulture, mypy, the unit suite under the canonical 87 floor (`apps/agent/pyproject.toml` `addopts`), and the offline Docker-arm integration suite. This is the one Docker use the hook itself makes. `packages/contract` is here because the agent consumes the contract and CI's `agent` job is routed the same way (#1323). |
| `migrations/neon/**` | `atlas migrate validate --dir file://migrations/neon` — no container. The disposable fresh-schema apply lives in CI's `db` job and in `make check-full`. |
| `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, root-level `*.md`, an `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or `CONTEXT.md` at any depth, and the spec-reference gate's own three files (`check-spec-references.sh`, `check-spec-references.test.sh`, `spec-reference-exceptions.txt`) | `check-agents-refs.sh`, `check-docs-paths.sh`, `check-root-allowlist.sh`, `check-spec-references.sh` — the same four the CI `docs` job runs on every pull request. |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml`, root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.npmrc` | Every workspace package. A root dependency change belongs to no project directory, and pnpm answers it with the root project alone — `...` adds none of its dependents — so "affected" has to mean everything. CI's `plan` job routes it the same way, through its `deps` paths-filter, and like CI's matrix this path drops the `...` closure: with every package already selected, the prefix would only re-run each one's dependents once per selected package. |

### docs/specs liveness (#1649)

A spec nobody names cannot be found, reviewed or superseded. `check-spec-references.sh` requires
every tracked file under `docs/specs/` to appear by basename, as a whole word, in another tracked
file outside `docs/archive/` — the 2026-09-14 sweep that opened the card found four that did not,
three of them describing surfaces already gone. (Two specs sharing a basename still count as named
either is; none in the tree does.) A file that has to stay unreferenced goes in
`scripts/local-gates/spec-reference-exceptions.txt` with the canonical owner that justifies it —
the owner is free text (a path, an issue number or a surface name), and the gate requires only
that it is named. An entry with no owner, outside `docs/specs/`, naming an untracked path, or
written without the `|` separator fails the gate closed, and the gate's own files are never a
reference, so an entry cannot justify itself. Those three files — the gate, its behavioral test
and the owner table — fire the docs bucket on their own: `scripts/**` needs no package gate, and
CI's `docs` job runs the same gate on every pull request.

### The whitelist, and failing closed

Paths that need no package gate, because another hook or a CI job already owns them:

```text
docs/**  .claude/**  .github/**  .semgrep*  scripts/**  test/repo-config/**
root-level *.md  codecov.yml  .pre-commit-config.yaml  commitlint.config.js  Makefile  .gitignore
```

`.gitignore` is consumed by the repository secret scan and tracked-file checks; its exact root
path needs no package gate. A sibling such as `.gitignore-extra` remains unowned and fails closed.

**Every** changed path has to be owned by something: a selected package's directory, a bucket that
actually fired, or the whitelist. Whatever is left over stops the push and is listed by name. The
check runs on the whole diff rather than only when nothing was selected — otherwise a commit that
touched `workers/catalog/src/` *and* added a stray top-level file would sail through on the strength
of its first half, which is exactly what it did until #1371's review caught it.

A new top-level directory, a new tool config: both stop the push with their own names in the
message rather than passing unexamined. The fix is to give the path a home — a package, a bucket,
or a reviewed whitelist entry — not to widen the pattern reflexively. (`commitlint.config.js` is on
the whitelist because turning this check on found it owned by nothing at all.)

The ownership set is built from what actually happened, so it also backstops the selection itself.
Each bucket adds its own paths only when it fired, and each selected package adds its directory, so
breaking the prefix join or deleting a bucket leaves the paths they used to own unaccounted and the
push goes red naming them. That is also why the loop skips a blank project line: an empty `pnpm ls`
result still yields one, and without the guard it would match every file and fill the package set
with nothing.

## `make check-full` (manual, not a hook)

The everything-run, for a large refactor or when a lockfile change makes "affected" mean everything:

```text
pnpm -r run --if-present lint | typecheck                 parallel
pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=1 run --if-present test | test:integration
scripts/local-gates/db-fresh-schema.sh        disposable fresh-schema apply (Docker)
pnpm --filter catalog run test:spike          the catalog spike against test-postgres
make check                                    the Python agent's own gate
```

The two suite segments run one package at a time on purpose. pnpm's default is one job per CPU, and
several packages' suites claim a fixed resource — the agent's `test:integration` boots
test-postgres, as does the catalog spike on the line above (catalog's own `test` was a third claimant
until #1473 moved the spike out of it) — while the browser suite, which used to be the loudest one,
now derives its port per checkout (#1692). In parallel they starve each other: nine browser specs
failed with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` while the same suite passed 43/43 on its own (2026-09-08).

## What stays in CI

- **Playwright browser e2e** (`make e2e`, the `animichi-e2e` package) — CI's `e2e` job owns it.
- **Live-Neon integration** (`TEST_DB=neon`) and BYO mutation databases — real data planes; a manual
  local option only, and not a CI lane either since #1053.
- **Model-backed evals** (`make test-eval`) — paid, non-deterministic.
- **Deploys and cloud commands** — `wrangler deploy`, mutating `pulumi`, codecov upload, `gh pr`.
- **The catalog spike** (`pnpm --filter catalog run test:spike`) — the Docker Postgres suite of
  `workers/catalog`. Kept out of that package's `test` so no pre-push starts a container for it
  (#1473); CI's `catalog` matrix lane runs it as a step of its own, and `make check-full` runs it
  locally.
- **The repository tests** (`.github/test/*.test.rb` and `test/repo-config/*.test.rb`) and the gate scripts' own behavioral
  tests — CI runs them unconditionally, on every pull request, so pre-push does not need a copy:
  `contracts` runs these plus the delivery suites, and `docs` runs the four docs-hygiene
  `check-*.test.sh` suites. `workflow-invocations.test.rb` asserts that every Ruby test in those directories and every
  shell check under `scripts/` and `.github/scripts/` is invoked by its exact path, and that every invoked
  repository script still exists. Deleting a check also requires deleting its CI invocation.

## Prerequisites

`git`, `pnpm`, `node` ≥ 24, `jq`, `uv` (agent bucket), `atlas` v0.30.0 (migrations bucket), `docker`
with the offline `animichi-test-postgres` image (the agent bucket's integration arm; no package's
`test` boots it any more, so the rest of pre-push is Docker-free), plus the pre-commit tools:
`shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `semgrep` 1.172.0, `ruby` for the contracts.

## Failure handling

- pre-commit: fix in the working tree and re-run — the fixer hooks modify files, so re-stage.
- pre-push: fix it. When the failure is environmental (no Docker daemon, no `atlas`), say so in the
  push and repair it; do not reach for `--no-verify`.
- "no gate covers these files": read the list. Each name is a path the repository has no opinion
  about yet.

## Files

- `scripts/local-gates/check-agents-refs.sh` / `check-docs-paths.sh` / `check-root-allowlist.sh` /
  `check-spec-references.sh` — the documentation hygiene checks, shared with CI's `docs` job
- `scripts/local-gates/spec-reference-exceptions.txt` — the docs/specs files allowed to stay
  unreferenced, each with its canonical owner
- `scripts/local-gates/db-fresh-schema.sh` — disposable fresh-schema apply (CI's `db` job,
  `make check-full`)
- `scripts/local-gates/infra-check.sh` — credential-free Pulumi program load (`infra`'s own `test`)
- `scripts/local-gates/contract-drift.sh` — staged-snapshot OpenAPI drift (`@animichi/contract`'s
  own `test`)
- `scripts/local-gates/*.test.sh` + `stub-env.sh` + `test-stub.sh` — those scripts' behavioral tests
  and the stub harness they share; CI's `contracts` job runs the non-docs `*.test.sh`, and its `docs`
  job runs the four `check-*.test.sh` suites
- `commitlint.config.js` — the commit-message and PR-title rules
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — hook wiring for all three stages
- This document — the contract

The TypeScript `@animichi/agent` domain library participates in this matrix. Its `workspace:*`
dependency from `edge-worker` makes domain changes select the real edge consumer as well.
