# W2 parity checklist — what the TS tier owes the Python agent, item by item

Spec `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md` §五 gives W2 one exit
criterion and it is a human one: **功能对等清单逐项勾（手动验证）**. There is no
automated eval before W3 (§二, owner decision), so this document IS the exit.

Card #1304, umbrella #1257, epic #1243.

Placement: `docs/ops/`, per `docs/DOCS_POLICY.md` rule 6 (operational docs live
under `docs/ops/`) — the same shelf as `docs/ops/w1-staging-journey.md`, which
this checklist ticks itself against. Nothing here changes behaviour.

The rows come from the merged W1/W2 PRs — #1277 #1278 #1281 #1282 #1284 #1286
and #1291 #1293 #1295 #1296 #1298 — plus the code they landed and the decision
issues they opened. A cell that cannot be sourced from one of those says so,
rather than guessing.

## How to read a row

- **Python behaviour** — paths are relative to `apps/agent/src/animichi/`, with a
  line number, because that tier is what "parity" is measured against and it is
  about to be deleted (§五 W4).
- **TS behaviour** — paths are relative to `workers/edge/src/`.
- **automated proof** — full repo paths. `workers/edge/test/*` runs in
  `pnpm run test:worker`; `workers/edge/agent-db-test/*` in
  `pnpm --filter edge-worker run test:agent-db`; `workers/edge/api-test/*` in
  `pnpm --filter edge-worker run test:catalog-api` against a real deploy;
  `packages/contract/test/*` in `pnpm --filter @animichi/contract test`.
  A cell reading `—` means no automated proof exists, and the divergence column
  then has to say why — `workers/edge/test/w2-parity-checklist-contract.test.ts`
  fails if it does not.
- **manual staging step** — a section of `docs/ops/w1-staging-journey.md`. `—`
  means the row is not observable from the browser and the automated proof is
  the whole evidence.
- **☐ ticked (owner)** — the owner flips this to ☑ during the manual pass and
  signs off on #1257.

## How to run the manual pass

Preconditions are `docs/ops/w1-staging-journey.md` §0: staging must be on a
deploy that carries `AGENT_TURN_ROUTE = "edge"` — merged is not deployed
(`docs/ops/deployment.md`) — and `/healthz` must answer 200.

**Credentials.** Two, neither of which belongs in this repo:

- `STAGING_GATE_TOKEN` — the WAF gate. Same variable and same value the
  Playwright suite turns into the `animichi_staging` cookie (`e2e/global-setup.ts`);
  the recipe and the reasoning are in `workers/edge/api-test/README.md` under
  "The staging gate". A Cloudflare 403 block page means the gate, not the app.
- `AGENT_TURN_BEARER` — any real staging Neon Auth access token; the browser's
  own session token works and is short-lived by design.

**The automated lanes**, from the repo root, after that deploy is live:

```sh
CATALOG_API_ORIGIN=https://staging.animichi.com \
AGENT_TURN_BEARER="$(cat ~/.animichi/staging-access-token)" \
STAGING_GATE_TOKEN="$(cat ~/.animichi/staging-gate-token)" \
pnpm --filter edge-worker run test:catalog-api
```

That is four suites: `workers/edge/api-test/catalog-api.test.ts` (no public
catalog door), `workers/edge/api-test/agent-turn.test.ts` (one real turn calling
`resolve_anime`, readable back), `workers/edge/api-test/web-search-turn.test.ts`
(the DuckDuckGo hop and the untrusted preamble) and
`workers/edge/api-test/byok-probe.test.ts` (the invalid-key rejection). All
three variables fail closed.

The offline suites this document points at run without any credential:

```sh
pnpm run test:worker
pnpm --filter edge-worker run test:agent-db   # needs Docker
pnpm --filter @animichi/contract test
```

**The browser journey** is `docs/ops/w1-staging-journey.md`, in one sitting, in
one fresh private window: §1 anonymous conversation → §2 leave mid-turn → §3
come back and pull the result → §3b clarify, pick, route → §3c web search →
§3d translation → §3e memory across turns → §3f BYOK → §4 the refusals.

**What to screenshot** — the journey names each one: S0 (deployed sha next to
`healthz`), S1–S3 (headers, frames, second turn), S4 (leaving mid-turn), S5
(the transcript with `run.status`), S5b–S5d (clarify id, the pick, the stale
refusal), S5e (the untrusted preamble), S5f (the translation part), S5g (the
cross-turn recall), S5h–S5j (the BYOK probe, the base-URL refusal, the
wrong-key 400). S5 is the one that decides W1; S5e, S5g and S5h are the ones
that decide W2.
