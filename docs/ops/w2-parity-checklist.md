# Native agent replacement evidence

The 82-row W2 map described the retired custom engine. It is superseded by the accepted
[Pi harness spec](../specs/2026-09-09-agent-on-pi-harness-spec.md) and #1553's native deletion
criteria. Git history retains the original W2 checklist; its old filenames are not a
requirement to preserve a duplicate runtime. This page records source test locations, not
owner ticks, deployment status or fabricated platform acceptance.

Run database lanes serially against disposable PostgreSQL, using the package guides.
Actual production resources, browser journeys, APAC timing, crash/reconnect scenarios and
the full accepted criteria still require their own recorded results. Native E1 command,
prefix fork corpus, calibrated judge and real-model suites are not complete merely because
old prefix endpoints and transcript adapters were deleted. See #1545, #1552, #1553, #1557,
#1558 and #1559 for those ownership boundaries.

The owner clarified on 2026-09-10 that production needs no backward compatibility. History
reads only native committed entries; this does not authorize deleting applied Atlas
migrations or online data. No legacy SQL history converter is retained.
