# Secrets inventory (GitHub repo + environment)

What every GitHub secret (repository-level and environment-level) and every credential-shaped
container env var is for, who consumes it, and what breaks if it is rotated. Started
2026-07-29 after setting `ANON_ID_SECRET` blind — the value went in with no record anywhere
of what it does.

The scope snapshot was checked read-only on 2026-08-01 with `gh secret list` for the repository,
`staging`, and `production` environments. Only secret names were requested; no secret value was
read. Re-run those three commands before any rotation because GitHub secret presence and scope
are provisioning state, while the source-consistency test below only sees names used by this
repository.

Companion to [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md), which covers non-secret runtime config
(`LOG_LEVEL`, `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, and the rest of `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` that never touch a
GitHub secret). **Values never appear here, in commit messages, in PR bodies, or in chat** —
see the "Handling" section at the bottom.

## This file rots by default — the test that keeps it honest

A one-time inventory snapshot goes stale the moment a secret is added, renamed, or
re-scoped, and nothing else notices. `gh secret list` cannot be the enforcement mechanism:
it needs a repo-admin PAT to run in CI (the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot list repo
secrets), and minting a standing admin token just to keep a doc honest is a net-negative
trade. Instead,
[`apps/agent/src/animichi/tests/unit/test_secrets_docs_consistency.py`](../../apps/agent/src/animichi/tests/unit/test_secrets_docs_consistency.py)
does it with zero credentials, by grepping source instead of asking GitHub:

- **A** = every name used as `${{ secrets.X }}` anywhere under `.github/workflows/**`, plus
  every credential-shaped name in `workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts`'s `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`
  (`_API_KEY` / `_TOKEN` / `_SECRET` suffix) — the rest of that list
  is plain runtime config with no GitHub secret behind it, and stays out of scope here (see
  `deployment.md`).
- **B** = every name in this file's two tables (Live + Referenced by nothing).
- `test_every_workflow_secret_and_credential_container_key_is_documented`: **A ⊆ B**. Code
  reaches for a secret this file has never heard of → red.
- `test_live_table_entries_are_still_actually_referenced`: every name in the **Live** table is
  still in A. A secret's last reference gets deleted and the row doesn't move to
  "Referenced by nothing" → red, not a silent stale claim.

Follows the shape of `apps/agent/src/animichi/tests/unit/test_anonymous_docs_consistency.py`, which
does the same job for `ARCHITECTURE.md` against `workers/edge/src/identity/auth.ts`.

## Same-name override rule

`cd.yml` runs each ordered staging job under `environment: staging`, and runs the one production
promotion under `environment: production`.
GitHub resolves an environment secret over a same-named repository secret for any job that
declares that environment — **so when a name exists at both scopes, only the environment-level
value is ever live for a staging/production deploy; rotating the repository-level one there
does nothing.** The table below marks scope explicitly per name instead of assuming repo-level.

There is no PR-preview, manual, or tag-triggered deploy workflow in the current tree. Consequently,
the repository-level copies of `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
`NEON_DATABASE_URL`, `PULUMI_BACKEND_URL`, `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` are referenced inside environment-scoped jobs, so the
matching staging/production environment value wins. The repository copy is not a separate deploy
path.

## Three consumption chains

A secret reaching a shared environment takes one of three shapes:

1. **Edge-to-container core chain** — `.github/workflows/cd.yml` passes exactly these six names
   through the local staging action into edge promotion:
   `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `MIMO_API_KEY`, `ZEN_GO_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_DB_URL`,
   `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, and `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`.
   `.github/scripts/edge-runtime-secrets.py` derives the allowlist from the sealed target
   `wrangler.toml` and rejects every missing or blank required value before any deploy.
   `.github/scripts/promote-release-unit.sh` then deploys the sealed edge payload and, only after
   that succeeds, `.github/scripts/sync-edge-runtime-secrets.sh` sends one JSON object over stdin
   to `wrangler secret bulk`. No value is placed in argv. `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` in
   `workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts` forwards the six bindings into the agent.
2. **Worker-only anonymous chain** — the renderer adds `TURNSTILE_SECRET` and `ANON_ID_SECRET`
   only when the sealed target config says `ANON_ACCESS_ENABLED = "true"`. Staging is true, so
   both names are preflighted and bulk-written there. Production is false, so both are excluded.
   Normal production promotion and production rollback call the same edge promotion script with
   the same `production` target and therefore use the same six-name core payload.
3. **Plain var chain** — never a GitHub secret at all; a literal value checked into
   `wrangler.toml`'s `[vars]` (or `[env.<name>.vars]`), forwarded to the container the same way
   as (1) via `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`. Reference implementation: `ANON_DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD`.
   1. `wrangler.toml` — add the literal value under the relevant `[vars]` section(s).
   2. `workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts` — add the name to `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`.
   3. `deployment.md`'s environment tables (not this file — nothing secret-shaped happened).

`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` has completed the chain-1 → chain-3 migration for both environments
(#1047): the value is a checked-in `[env.*.vars]` wrangler var (staging and production alike),
so it no longer has a Live row here — see its "Referenced by nothing" row below.

## Live secrets

| Secret | Scope | What it is | Value lives in / read by | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | repo + `staging` + `production` (environment value wins for current deploys) | Deploys Workers; needs `Workers Scripts:Edit` | `cd.yml` staging and production promotion | Rotating the environment-level value breaks that environment's promotion. Create the replacement first, update the intended scope, then revoke the old one |
| `CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_API_TOKEN` | `staging` + `production` environments | Pulumi 专用最小权限 token(R2:Edit + Zone DNS/Routes/Rulesets:Edit,zone 限 animichi.com;不含 Workers Scripts/Containers)— #674 最小权限分离 | `cd.yml` staging/production foundation state snapshot + `pulumi up` | 与 wrangler token 分离即为轮换/爆炸半径隔离;轮换在 CF dashboard 原地 Edit 权限或 Roll 后更新两环境 secret |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | repo + `staging` + `production` (same override rule as above) | Account identifier (not a credential, stored as a secret for convenience) | All current deploy and rollback workflows | Rotating an environment value breaks that environment's URL resolution/deploy; the repo-level copy is shadowed in environment-scoped CD jobs |
| `ZEN_GO_API_KEY` | repo (no env override) | **Production LLM gateway.** MiMo `mimo-v2.5` is routed through the zen/go gateway (`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`) | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container; also the affected `CI / agent eval` lane and `agent-eval-nightly.yml`, both through `.github/actions/agent-eval` | Missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight. Eval lanes 401/403 the provider and the user sees the agent's generic failure response, never the raw provider error (SD-19) |
| `MIMO_API_KEY` | repo (no env override) | Retired direct-gateway credential retained as an explicit rollback-capable runtime binding | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container | It is required even while zen/go is the default; missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | repo (no env override) | Fallback model — **wired but disabled** (no balance) | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container | It remains an exact required binding; missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL` | repo (no env override) | Transitional production container DSN name pending the #855 agent-service cutover | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container; both deployed environments now prefer their `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` Secrets Store binding (production since W4-1, #1314) | Missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight; remove it from the core allowlist only as part of the #855 cutover |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | repo (no env override) | Geocoding (`apps/agent/src/animichi/infrastructure/gateways/geocoding.py`) | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container | Missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight; an invalid value surfaces later as place-resolution failure |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | repo (no env override) | Cloudflare Turnstile siteverify secret | Staging-only anonymous payload → edge `workers/edge/src/protect/turnstile.ts`; excluded from production and rollback because anonymous access is off | Missing or blank blocks staging edge promotion at preflight; wrong value makes anonymous chat fail closed with `turnstile_required` |
| `ANON_ID_SECRET` | repo (no env override) | HMAC key for signed anonymous visitor identities | Staging-only anonymous payload → edge `workers/edge/src/identity/auth.ts`; excluded from production and rollback because anonymous access is off | Missing or blank blocks staging edge promotion. Rotation invalidates existing anonymous identities and can orphan unmigrated anonymous session ownership |
| `NEON_DATABASE_URL` | repo (**unreachable** — see "Same-name override rule"; no non-environment-scoped caller exists today) + `staging` + `production` | Catalog data plane | Production `db` promotion's Atlas migration; catalog/users runtime DSNs come from Cloudflare Secrets Store bindings | Wrong value → Atlas migrate fails closed; rotate one environment at a time |
| `NEON_API_KEY` | repo (no env override) | Neon data-plane control-plane key for provisioning (#926, ADR 0003); no longer a test-infra credential since #1053 | Staging and production release promotion through `cd.yml` | Removing it blocks the affected infrastructure/migration promotion units |
| `PULUMI_BACKEND_URL` · `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` | repo (**unreachable** — no non-environment-scoped caller) + `staging` + `production` | Pulumi state on R2 and its encryption passphrase | Foundation promotion in `cd.yml` | **Losing the passphrase makes existing state undecryptable.** Back it up outside this repo. This is the loudest possible failure: `pulumi up` refuses to proceed |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` · `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | repo (**unreachable** — no non-environment-scoped caller) + `staging` + `production` | R2 credentials for the Pulumi state bucket | Foundation promotion state snapshots and R2 backend access | Wrong value → Pulumi's R2-backed state backend fails to authenticate, loud failure on the next `pulumi` invocation |
| `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` | repo (**unreachable** — no non-environment-scoped caller) + `staging` + `production`, each a **different** Logfire project (`animichi-staging` / `animichi-prod`) as of 2026-07-29, replacing one shared `LOGFIRE_TOKEN_PROD`/`LOGFIRE_TOKEN_STAGING` pair that lived less than eight hours (wiring was #498) | Write token for the environment's Logfire project | Exact edge core payload → Worker binding → agent container | Missing or blank blocks edge staging, production, and rollback at preflight. A wrong-but-present value only stops traces for that environment |

## Referenced by nothing

Found by grepping every secret name across `.github/workflows/` and `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`
against every source tree in the repo, plus the read-only GitHub name snapshot above. **These are
not one kind of finding** — read the action column before batching a decision:

| Secret | Finding | Owner action |
|---|---|---|
| `STAGING_GATE_TOKEN` | The staging WAF gate remains, but no current workflow can read this GitHub environment secret after automatic smoke was deferred | Owner smoke must use an independently held break-glass value; either add a future approved smoke workflow that explicitly consumes this secret or delete the unreachable GitHub copy after confirming the gate's source of truth |
| `AGENT_DATABASE_URL` | The production maintenance Worker may still read this DSN, but no current workflow forwards it | Confirm whether the maintenance Worker remains deployed; wire it into CD if retained, otherwise retire the Worker and then delete the secret |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | A GCP service-account private key, added 2025-12, referenced nowhere in code or workflows — the only row here with a real blast radius if it leaked (a live cloud credential, not an inert config name) | Check GCP IAM for any usage of this SA outside this repo; if none, revoke it in GCP first, then `gh secret delete GCP_SA_KEY`. Open an issue to track — do not batch with the rows below |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Companion to `GCP_SA_KEY`, same 2025-12 origin, referenced nowhere | Delete once `GCP_SA_KEY` is confirmed dead and revoked |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Added 2026-05, referenced nowhere | `gh secret delete CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — no dependency to check first |
| `ZETA_API_KEY` | Model-provider key for Z.AI — was listed in `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` (`workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts`) but **no workflow ever passed it** and no source reads it, a broken chain. Retired under the MiMo-only key convergence (#684): removed from the forwarding allowlist, with the policy decision (Zeta is not a wanted provider) recorded in the `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` comment block | `gh secret delete ZETA_API_KEY` — no dependency to check first |
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` | Read by `apps/agent/src/animichi/config/settings.py` and `apps/agent/src/animichi/config/model_aliases.py`, listed in `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`, but again **no workflow passes it** — broken chain: the allowlist expects a value no workflow ever forwards | Keep-or-retire decision, not a delete: code still reads this credential, so retiring it means first removing its references from `settings.py` / `model_aliases.py`, then the `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` entry and this row |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` · `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Repository secrets present in the 2026-08-01 snapshot, but no workflow or source file references either name; the old Dependabot/Claude path was retired | Confirm no external automation still uses them, then delete both repository secrets |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Repository secret present in the 2026-08-01 name snapshot, but no workflow, `apps/web` source, or `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` entry references it. The current map stack is MapLibre GL + Protomaps PMTiles and the Mapbox ADR is explicitly retired/banned. If a future Mapbox integration is approved, this `NEXT_PUBLIC_` token would be a **public browser client token**, not a container secret; it would need URL restrictions and a public build variable instead of secret forwarding. | Confirm no external deployment still consumes it, revoke the token in the Mapbox console, then `gh secret delete NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`. Do not move it to Live or add it to `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Was Live (this table, above) until #656 (2026-08-04): photo-search recognition now rides the main agent's multimodal input (`apps/agent/src/animichi/agents/photo_vision.py`) instead of the standalone `GeminiVisionProvider`, so nothing in `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS`, `wrangler.toml`, or any workflow reads this name anymore | `gh secret delete GEMINI_API_KEY` once the deploy carrying #656 is confirmed live in production — no dependency to check first, the code path it fed no longer exists |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | Was Live (this table, above) until #1047 (2026-08-15): demoted to a checked-in **wrangler var** — `[env.*.vars].CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` (asserted by `workers/edge/test/auth-config.test.ts`); no workflow forwards `${{ secrets.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN }}` anymore, so any residual GitHub secret (repo-level or `production` environment) is a dead binding | `gh secret delete CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` (repo) and `--env production` if present — the value now lives in the checked-in wrangler vars |
| `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL` | Was Live (this table, above) until #1047: the edge's only identity source is now provisioned as a Cloudflare Secrets Store entry (name constant `NEON_AUTH_JWKS_VAR` in `infra/src/neon-auth.ts`, value written by the infra/database-access stack `index.ts`) with the checked-in wrangler var as the dev/placeholder path — no workflow references `${{ secrets.NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL }}` anymore | `gh secret delete NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL --env staging` and `--env production` if present — the value now lives in the Cloudflare Secrets Store / wrangler vars |
| `CATALOG_DATABASE_URL` | Migrated to the Cloudflare Secrets Store (#912 PR2): the catalog Worker's staging DSN now arrives via the `[[env.staging.secrets_store_secrets]]` binding in `workers/catalog/wrangler.toml`, so no workflow or GH secret reference remains. The staging GH secret still exists only until the binding swap is verified live | After the first post-PR2 staging deploy passes its post-deploy suite, `gh secret delete CATALOG_DATABASE_URL --env staging` |
| `USERS_DATABASE_URL` | Migrated to the Cloudflare Secrets Store (#912 PR2): the users Worker's staging DSN now arrives via the `[[env.staging.secrets_store_secrets]]` binding in `workers/users/wrangler.toml`, so no workflow or GH secret reference remains. The staging GH secret still exists only until the binding swap is verified live | After the first post-PR2 staging deploy passes its post-deploy suite, `gh secret delete USERS_DATABASE_URL --env staging` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` · `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Retired Supabase auth-plane credentials. No source, workflow, release manifest, or runtime reads either name after the Neon Auth hard cut | `gh secret delete SUPABASE_URL` then `gh secret delete SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. (`SUPABASE_DB_URL` is a separate transitional container-DSN name.) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Retired Supabase service-role credential. No source, workflow, release manifest, or runtime reads it | `gh secret delete SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |

Deleting is a per-row decision, not a batch one: `GCP_SA_KEY` needs an external check before
deletion, the one remaining broken chain (`OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY`) needs a keep-or-retire
decision (not a delete) — `ZETA_API_KEY`'s retirement was already decided in #684 (MiMo-only) —
Mapbox needs a provider-side revocation check, and only `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is safe to
delete immediately.

## Cloudflare Secrets Store (not GitHub secrets)

#912 PR2 moved the per-component Neon DSNs out of GitHub secrets and into the **Cloudflare
Secrets Store** (the account's default store, id `66c9bb0faef644b4a0671bb7d90d98bd`; a second
store is refused by the account plan, `maximum_stores_exceeded`). Values are managed by the
`infra/database-access` Pulumi stack (staging branch roles + composed DSNs; see its `index.ts` for
the role→secret mapping and the bootstrap/rotation runbook). This file only covers GitHub
secrets, so store secrets are listed here for the reader, not enforced by
`test_secrets_docs_consistency.py`:

| Store secret | Worker binding | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `CATALOG_DATABASE_URL` | `DATABASE_URL` | `workers/catalog/wrangler.toml` `[[env.staging.secrets_store_secrets]]` → `workers/catalog/src/index.ts` (`await env.DATABASE_URL.get()`) |
| `CATALOG_DATABASE_URL_PROD` | `DATABASE_URL` | `workers/catalog/wrangler.toml` `[[env.production.secrets_store_secrets]]` → `workers/catalog/src/index.ts` |
| `USERS_DATABASE_URL` | `DATABASE_URL` | `workers/users/wrangler.toml` `[[env.staging.secrets_store_secrets]]` → `workers/users/src/index.ts` |
| `USERS_DATABASE_URL_PROD` | `DATABASE_URL` | `workers/users/wrangler.toml` `[[env.production.secrets_store_secrets]]` → `workers/users/src/index.ts` |
| `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` | `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` | `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` `[[env.staging.secrets_store_secrets]]` → two consumers of the one binding: `workers/edge/src/container/container-env.ts` (forwarded into the agent container) and, from W1 (#1251), the edge Worker itself in `workers/edge/src/db/agent-database.ts` (the agent turn tier reads Neon directly) |
| `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL_PROD` | `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` | `workers/edge/wrangler.toml` `[[env.production.secrets_store_secrets]]` → the same two consumers (W4-1, #1314) |

Bindings are declared per environment in `wrangler.toml` (`secrets_store_secrets` is
non-inheritable) and are applied automatically by `wrangler deploy` — no CI secret upload step
exists for them. The fail-closed guard is the binding itself: a missing store id/secret fails
the deploy API call, and `env.<binding>.get()` throws at runtime if the secret is ever deleted.
Note that `secrets.required` must NOT list a name that is also a Secrets Store binding —
wrangler rejects a name assigned to both binding types.

Catalog, users and the agent service all have distinct staging and `_PROD` store secrets because
both environments share one Cloudflare store — the account plan refuses a second, so the secret
name is the only thing separating the two environments' credentials. Their runtime DSNs are
bindings in both environments; CI does not upload them.

The agent-service binding was staging-only until W4-1 (#1314), which provisioned the production
`agent_svc` DSN through the `infra/database-access` prod stack and bound it on the production edge
Worker. Landing the binding changed no runtime behaviour: `AGENT_TURN_ROUTE` stays `"container"` in
production, so the binding only moves where the container's DSN comes from, and production edge
still receives `SUPABASE_DB_URL` through the exact core bulk payload until the cutover's later step
retires it (`docs/ops/prod-dsn-cutover.md`). Local dev is unchanged (`.dev.vars`) and binds no store
secret at all, which is why `AGENT_SVC_DATABASE_URL` is not in `CONTAINER_REQUIRED_KEYS`.

## Adding a new secret

Pick the matching chain above. A new core container secret needs an explicit workflow declaration,
an entry in `CORE_NAMES` in `.github/scripts/edge-runtime-secrets.py`, the matching
`CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` entry, this inventory, and contract plus mutation coverage. A Worker-only
secret belongs in the renderer's explicit conditional allowlist instead. For a non-secret Wrangler
var, use `ANON_DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD` as the reference and never add it to a secret payload.

## Handling

- Never paste a value into chat, a PR body, an issue, or a commit message. This repository
  has burned two secrets that way (a Turnstile secret on 2026-07-26, a Logfire read token
  on 2026-07-29) — in both cases the leak happened while *reporting* a rotation.
- Shared-environment deploys and secret writes are **CD-only**. Developers must not run
  deployment or secret-mutation commands from a workstation; the reviewed main-only `cd.yml`
  promotion is the supported write path. Edge values flow only through the reviewed
  `sync-edge-runtime-secrets.sh` stdin pipeline into one `wrangler secret bulk` call.
- Keep values out of process arguments in every approved provisioning path. A GitHub secret
  body-file/stdin interface (for example, `openssl rand -hex 32 | gh secret set <NAME>
  --body-file -`) avoids placing the value in argv; this is CI/admin automation guidance, not a
  command for developer workstations. A `--body "..."` value can be exposed through process
  listings, `/proc`, shell tracing, or persisted command history. Stdin avoids argv exposure but
  does not make the value public-proof, so never echo it or write it to a shared file.
- When a value must be identified, quote a prefix and a length (`pylf_v…[55 chars]`), never
  the whole thing.
- Non-TTY Wrangler secret writes can create a missing Worker. Edge promotion therefore preflights
  every required value, deploys the sealed Worker, and only then runs `secret bulk`; developers
  must not run that mutation path locally.
