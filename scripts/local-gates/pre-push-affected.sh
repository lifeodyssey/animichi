# What is gated is HEAD's diff, and the pushed refs are read to prove that is
# the right thing to gate. git feeds the hook one
# `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>` record per ref; pre-commit's
# wrapper eats that stdin and re-exports the first pushable one as
# PRE_COMMIT_{TO,FROM}_REF, so read stdin when there is any and fall back to the
# variables (`[ -t 0 ]` keeps a by-hand terminal run from blocking on a read that
# never arrives). Pushing a ref that is not HEAD is refused rather than gated:
# the paths would come from that ref while `pnpm ls` and every package script ran
# against the checked-out tree, so a broken change could pass on someone else's
# green. This repository is one worktree per card, so the rule costs nothing.
