#
# Hermetic: every case builds a throwaway git repository under one temp root
# with its own `origin/main`, a fake `pnpm` / `make` / `atlas` on PATH and the
# four documentation checks stubbed. No real suite, container or network call.
# The fake pnpm does double duty — it answers `ls -r --depth -1 --json` and
# records every `run` asked of it: the selected set, the serial flag and the
# absent `...` closure are read off it. GATE_UNDER_TEST points at a mutant.
