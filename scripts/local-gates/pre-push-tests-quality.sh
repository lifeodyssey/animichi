# Covers the ruby -c syntax lane: CI (pipeline-quality.yml) runs `ruby -c`
# once per Ruby script, and the gate mirrors that — a single `ruby -c a b c`
# would only ever check the first path and silently skip every later file.
# The regression drives the REAL quality.sh from a deterministic temp tree
# that is missing the LAST Ruby path: the gate must fail fast and name the
# missing path.
