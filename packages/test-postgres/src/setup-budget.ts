/** Every wall-clock allowance one suite may spend getting its data plane up.
 *
 * ONE deadline covers the phases that can hang — the port bind and the
 * connection waits — rather than one timeout each. Three independent timeouts
 * was the bug #1318 found: 240 s for the bind plus 60 s per wait is 360 s
 * inside a 300 s hook, so a slow boot killed the lane instead of failing the
 * phase that overran. Here the phases share `deadlineMs`: the bind is capped by
 * all of it, and each wait by whatever the bind left behind.
 *
 * `chainMarginMs` is the room after those phases for the clean database and the
 * Atlas chain — a local socket with no network, seconds in practice — and the
 * room for an exhausted deadline to throw and be read as an error rather than
 * as a killed hook. `hookTimeoutMs` is their sum: what a `before` awaiting the
 * whole setup must allow.
 *
 * The two arms differ in exactly one number, and deliberately:
 * `workers/catalog`'s spike suite boots ONE container for the whole suite and
 * probes 30 × 1 s (#1324); `workers/edge`'s agent-db lane boots one PER FILE,
 * serially, so its first session can queue behind another boot and it keeps
 * 60 × 1 s (#1318). Do not harmonise them.
