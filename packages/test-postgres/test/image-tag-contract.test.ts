/**
 * Every consumer of the offline image must resolve the SAME tag (#1326).
 *
 * They used to carry three copies of it: the catalog spike fixture, the edge
 * agent-db fixture and `scripts/local-gates/db-fresh-schema.sh`. A tag that
 * drifts in one of them does not fail — it silently boots a different (or a
 * missing) image, which is why this is a gate rather than a convention. The
 * native rewrite (#1582) retired the single edge arm file, so the edge side of
 * this contract is now the set of lane fixtures, discovered the same way the
 * setup-budget witness discovers them.
 *
 * Two consumers are TypeScript and one is bash, so the single declaration is
 * `postgres-image.env` and each side reads it its own way. This test resolves
 * BOTH ways — it runs the shell read rather than reading the shell — and then
 * checks that no consumer kept a tag of its own to drift with. The Python
 * consumer (`apps/agent/src/animichi/tests/conftest_db.py`) reads the same file
 * and has its own contract:
 * `apps/agent/src/animichi/tests/unit/test_conftest_db_image_tag.py`.
 *
 * The fourth place the tag appears is the workflow step that BUILDS the image.
 * A `run:` can source the declaration, so that step keeps no copy either, and
 * this package no longer reads `.github/workflows/pr-verification.yml` to find
 * out (card B2 / #1360): pipeline text is the CI contract's to read, and
 * `.github/test/pr-verification-affected.test.rb` reads the declaration too, so
 * neither side holds a second copy of the tag.
 *
 * test-type: unit (reads checked-in files and one `bash -c`; no network).
