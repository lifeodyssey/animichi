/**
 * The three consumers of the offline image must resolve the SAME tag (#1326).
 *
 * They used to carry three copies of it: the catalog spike fixture, the edge
 * agent-db fixture and `scripts/local-gates/db-fresh-schema.sh`. A tag that
 * drifts in one of them does not fail — it silently boots a different (or a
 * missing) image, which is why this is a gate rather than a convention.
 *
 * Two consumers are TypeScript and one is bash, so the single declaration is
 * `postgres-image.env` and each side reads it its own way. This test resolves
 * BOTH ways — it runs the shell read rather than reading the shell — and then
 * checks that no consumer kept a tag of its own to drift with.
 *
 * test-type: unit (reads checked-in files and one `bash -c`; no network).
