/**
 * The two arms' budgets, and the proof that each still spends its own.
 *
 * #1326 merged two data-plane fixtures onto one recipe. The numbers were NOT
 * merged with them — the catalog spike keeps 30 x 1 s (#1324), the edge
 * agent-db lane keeps 60 x 1 s (#1318) because its first session can queue
 * behind the shared container's creation, by another lane or another worktree.
 * Pinning the values here is only half of it: the other
 * half is that the deadline is derived, never re-written — #1318's arm file
 * used to do the deriving, and since the native rewrite (#1582) retired that
 * arm, `startTestPostgres` derives from whatever budget the caller hands it.
 *
 * The fixture set is enumerated from the lane directories, never pinned to a
 * count: a number here is a tripwire that fires in this package whenever
 * another package adds a lane (#1386, #1387), and it proves nothing the
 * per-file assertions below do not already prove.
 *
 * test-type: unit (reads checked-in files; no network, no clock).
