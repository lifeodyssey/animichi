/**
 * API operation sets — the shared vocabulary for OpenAPI/runtime parity.
 *
 * One "operation" is an HTTP method bound to a route template (e.g.
 * `GET /v1/users/saved-routes`). Both generated OpenAPI documents and oRPC
 * contracts reduce to this same shape, which is what makes "the generated
 * surface equals the mounted surface" a machine check (issue #1005 AC1).
 *
 * Two extraction paths are provided:
 *  - `operationsFromOpenApi` walks a generated OpenAPI document's `paths`;
 *  - `operationsFromContractRouter` reads each oRPC contract procedure's
 *    route definition. Flat routers only: a nested router value fails loudly
 *    rather than being silently skipped.
 *
 * The wire-shape types (`WireSchema` / `WireOperation` / `ApiDocument`) are a
 * deliberate structural mirror of the emitted JSON — deliberately minimal, so
 * both the emitter and the diff/vet tooling read and write the same shape.
