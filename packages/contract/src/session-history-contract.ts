 * The `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/messages` boundary (SESSION-1 #959), which

 * (E-2 #1381).
 *
 * It is its own module rather than a section of `agent-contract.ts` because it
 * is its own surface: one route, one use case on each tier
 * (`apps/agent/.../get_session_history.py` and
 * `workers/edge/src/agent/retrieval/`), and every consumer of these five
 * schemas wants exactly this route. `agent-contract.ts` keeps the shapes that
 * have no such home — health, the turn request, photo search, feedback.
 *
 * Emitted like every other boundary model: `scripts/emit-agent-python.ts`
 * reads these declarations, `test/agent-boundary.test.ts` fails on drift, and
 * `packages/contract/src/index.ts` re-exports them so the root import path is
 * unchanged.

 * `response_model_exclude_none`. Absent is every payload captured before this
 * field existed, which today's client still has to keep parsing.
 *
 * `steps` is additive on the same terms (E-2 #1381): every settled step of
 * every run of this session, each under the run that numbered it, so a caller
 * pairing a call with its settled params never has to guess which run answered
 * it. Same two absent shapes — null from the Python route, missing from every
