# packages/contract — AGENTS.md

Shared oRPC/Zod contract and single source of truth for catalog/users wire types. The catalog
Worker and Python agent keep deliberate hand-mirrors where bundling or sentinel defaults require
them. Root guide: `../../AGENTS.md`; detailed mirror checklist: `README.md`.

## Commands (from `packages/contract/`)

- `pnpm run lint` / `pnpm run lint:oxlint` — type-aware oxlint over `src/` and `scripts/`, warnings
  denied. That is the package's TypeScript program: `tsconfig.json` does not include `test/`, so a
  type-aware pass there would report on `any` (bringing the tests into the program is a separate
  outcome — `tsc` has ~60 findings under them today).
- `pnpm run typecheck` — TypeScript 7.0.2 `tsc --noEmit`.
- `pnpm test` — vitest, then the compat gate (`vet:baseline`) and the OpenAPI drift check
  (`test:openapi-drift`). One command, the same one CI runs (#1358).
- `pnpm run emit:openapi` — regenerate `openapi.json`, `users-openapi.json`, and `agent-openapi.json`.
- `pnpm run emit:tool-schemas` — regenerate `src/agent-tool-schemas.ts` from
  `src/agent-tool-parameters.ts`. This is the repo's **single** zod↔JSON-Schema conversion
  (agent TS rewrite spec §二, "schema 边界"): the agent's four catalog tool parameter schemas, the
  two web tools' (`web_search`, `translate_anime_title`, #1287) and the `respond` answer tool's are
  declared here in zod — the catalog ones composed from the catalog's own request constraints, the
  web ones composing nothing because there is no second declaration for them to agree with.
  Native Pi tools consume the generated JSON Schema; the actual oRPC catalog client also uses
  the contract's runtime validators. The module carries `ANSWER_TOOL_NAME` and
  `CHAT_RESPONSE_INTENTS` (read off `ChatResponseDataPart`'s own union, #1283) for consumers that
  only need those values. `test/agent-tool-schemas.test.ts` fails on committed drift,
  the way the OpenAPI documents do; `test/chat-answer-part.test.ts` parses what the edge's
  projection actually emits. Never hand-edit the generated file.
- `pnpm run vet:openapi <baseline.json> <candidate.json> --document <name>` — OpenAPI
  compat gate (issue #1005 AC4/AC5): fails on unapproved breaking changes, approves
  additive ones, and rejects a future major path unless its superseded operation
  carries `deprecated: true` + `x-sunset`. The run names the published document it
  vets, because the only approval it reads is that document's committed record
  (`src/approved-breaking-changes.ts`, #1596). `--allow-breaking` is the manual human
  override — it waives every breaking change in one run, never reads the record, and
  is never passed by the normal CI gate.

OpenAPI emission is byte-stable: JSON is pretty-printed with one trailing newline. Regenerate on
every contract change and commit all three outputs. `pnpm test` reruns emission and fails on
committed drift (`scripts/local-gates/contract-drift.sh`), then runs `vet:openapi` for each document
against the merge-base baseline (the published contract) through `scripts/vet-openapi-baseline.ts` —
unapproved breaking `/v1` changes fail closed there, locally and in CI alike. An intentional breaking
change is approved by adding a dated entry to `src/approved-breaking-changes.ts` that names it exactly
(document, method, path, kind) with the issue that argued it; nothing else approves one. An entry is
valid while its removal is realised in the document being vetted — an `endpoint-removed` path answers
no method, a `method-removed` method+path is absent — so it stays valid once its own
change has landed and needs no cleanup commit, while an entry whose operation is still advertised
fails the run: an approval cannot precede the removal it names. Only
operation removals are recordable, because they are the breaking kinds whose realised state the
document itself can confirm. The baseline is always
the merge base's own copy of the document, never the source head's: a document the merge base does
not carry is brand-new, so it gets an empty `{"paths": {}}` baseline that approves every operation in
it as additive, while a merge base the repository cannot read at all — missing tree or blob, shallow
clone, corrupt object — exits 1 rather than approving an unreviewed deletion. The merge base is
`HEAD` against `CONTRACT_BASE_REF` (default `origin/main`), so a checkout without that ref fails
closed too; fetch the base branch before running the gate. The retired check-in/share bootstrap
fallback (#1005 AC3) was deleted in #1347 once every branch was post-cut.

## Conventions

- Zod schemas and oRPC contracts live in `src/`; export public types through `src/index.ts`.
- `zod@4.4.3` and `@orpc/*@1.14.10` are one coupled exact-pin set across this package,
  `workers/catalog`, `workers/users`, and `apps/web`. Change them together.
- Catalog internals use type-only hand-mirrors so Zod stays out of the Worker bundle; Python models
  remain hand-written because their sentinel defaults intentionally differ.
- Semantic contract freeze is the red line: do not change wire meaning without an approved story.
  Formatting churn is acceptable only when the OpenAPI drift check stays green.

## Key files + entrypoints

- `src/models.ts` — shared Zod data models.
- `src/agent-paths.ts` — `AGENT_PATHS`, the complete Agent HTTP path inventory ·
  `src/identity-policy.ts` — `DEFAULT_IDENTITY_POLICY`, the deployed identity matrix ·
  `test/import-free-modules.test.ts` — the gate over both. `workers/edge` reads these two
  documents at RUNTIME, so they are declared apart from the zod modules that give them meaning
  (`agent-contract.ts`, `identity-contract.ts`), which do NOT re-export them: a value import from
  a zod module pulls all 79 of zod's files into the Worker bundle (#1285, measured by
  `workers/edge/bundle-smoke/entry-bundle.test.ts`). Nothing is generated and nothing is mirrored
  — each is the one declaration, and the emitters, the edge and the drift tests all read it there.
- `src/agent-tool-parameters.ts` — the agent's catalog tool parameters, the two web tools' and the
  `respond` answer tool's, in zod (not a wire type: no oRPC procedure and no OpenAPI document references them) ·
  `src/agent-tool-schemas.ts` — their generated JSON Schema · `scripts/emit-tool-schemas.ts` — the
  conversion · `test/agent-tool-schemas.test.ts` — its drift gate ·
  `test/chat-answer-part.test.ts` — the conformance gate on the edge's `data-response` projection.
- `src/access-service-token.ts` — the Cloudflare Access service token every automated
  caller presents at staging (D3 #1369): the two variable names, the two header names,
  and the fail-closed reader that refuses a HALF-declared token. Import-free because its consumers are a Playwright config
  (`e2e/playwright.config.ts`), a Node lane door (`workers/edge/api-test/lane-origin.ts`)
  neither of which should load zod to learn two
  header names. `test/access-service-token.test.ts` holds it; the values come from the
  `infra` stack output, never from anything checked in.
- `src/agent-step-origin.ts` — who asked for a step: native
  `workers/edge/src/agent/views/selection-response.ts` writes `serverStepOrigin()` onto
  deterministic selection's `tool-input-start` and `tool-input-available` frames.
  `stepOriginOf()` reads that public metadata; the retired Eval transcript shaper is no longer
  a consumer. This import-free module carries the SD-9 frame exception from rewrite spec
  §10.2.1 in `toolMetadata`, the protocol's own free-form slot. Absence means `model`;
  `test/agent-step-origin.test.ts` preserves the server marker and that default.
- `src/contract.ts` — catalog procedures and error attachments.
- `src/users-contract.ts` — users-service procedures and errors.
- `src/errors.ts` — canonical catalog error registry.
- `scripts/emit-openapi.ts` — deterministic OpenAPI emitter.
- `scripts/vet-openapi.ts` — OpenAPI compat gate CLI (baseline vs candidate, record vs document) ·
  `scripts/vet-openapi-baseline.ts` — the merge-base baseline the package's `test` vets against ·
  `src/approved-breaking-changes.ts` — the committed approval record the CLI reads (#1596).
- `openapi.json` · `users-openapi.json` · `agent-openapi.json` — committed generated wire artifacts.
- `src/openapi-changes.ts` · `src/openapi-approvals.ts` · `src/openapi-schema-diff.ts` ·
  `src/openapi-diff.ts` ·
  `src/openapi-vet.ts` · `test/openapi-diff-endpoints.test.ts` ·
  `test/openapi-diff-schemas.test.ts` · `test/openapi-diff-errors.test.ts` ·
  `test/openapi-gate.test.ts` · `test/vet-gate.test.ts` · `test/openapi-approvals.test.ts` ·
  `test/approved-breaking-changes.test.ts` · `test/vet-record-cli.test.ts` — change vocabulary
  (including the operation identity every change carries), the approval record's matching and
  realisation rules, the classifier, gate decisions, the record's hygiene rules, and the
  package-script wiring of the compat gate.

## Pitfalls

- Catalog errors move in three-mirror lockstep:
  `src/errors.ts` ↔ `workers/catalog/src/lib/errors.ts` ↔
  `apps/agent/src/animichi/clients/catalog_errors.py`.
- Extend `workers/catalog/test/contract-parity.worker.test.ts` and the Python error tests with any
  mirror change; do not rely on OpenAPI generation alone.
- Do not introduce runtime value imports into the catalog's type mirror.
