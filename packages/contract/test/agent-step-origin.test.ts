/**
 * #1462: the origin marker a step-opening SD-9 frame carries.
 *
 * The property the whole decision rests on is that it is ADDITIVE. Every frame
 * recorded before this member existed — the captures under
 * `packages/contract/fixtures/chat-stream/`, any deploy older than this card —
 * must keep meaning exactly what it meant, or a reader on the old shape starts
 * calling model calls something else. So absence reads back as `model`, and only
 * the marker the edge writes reads back as `server`.
 *
 * test-type: api.
