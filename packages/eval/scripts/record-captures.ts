/**
 * Record real staging turns into `fixtures/captures/` (W3-2 #1300).
 *
 * The shaper is built and tested against the Python-recorded SD-9 captures in
 * `apps/agent/tests/fixtures/chat_stream/`, because at the time this card was
 * implemented no `STAGING_GATE_TOKEN` was available to make a live one. Those
 * captures are the same wire (#1283 verified the edge frame for frame), so they
 * are a sound subject — but they are not evidence that a LIVE turn shapes the
 * same way. This script is how that evidence gets made once the credential
 * exists, and it writes the same two files per case the tests already read: the
 * stream, and the transcript read that follows it.
 *
 * It records through `StagingTurnTask` rather than beside it. A recorder with
 * its own submission loop would be a second place for the session threading and
 * the retry rule to drift from the thing being measured — and a capture taken
 * differently from the run it is supposed to pin proves nothing.
 *
 * Run it through `record-captures.sh`, which normalises the working directory.
