/**
 * The shaper against the recorded Python captures (W3-2 #1300).
 *
 * The expectation is NOT written here. `apps/agent/tests/fixtures/chat_stream/`
 * carries, beside each `.sse`, an `<name>.agent-result.json` that the Python
 * recorder builds from the same turn with the eval evaluators' OWN accessors —
 * so what this suite compares is the wire-derived result against Python's
 * `AgentResult` as those evaluators read it, not against a second opinion typed
 * by the same hand that wrote the shaper.
 *
 * WHAT THE CAPTURES ARE AND ARE NOT. Their FRAME GRAMMAR is the deployed edge's
 * — #1283 built `turn-frames.ts` off these files and matched them frame for
 * frame — so everything the trajectory is read from is current. Their answer
 * ENVELOPE is not: `record_fixtures.py` records that re-running it today empties
 * the search capture's `data`, because `agent_result_to_response` now projects
 * the payload from the session registry rather than from the mapping handed to
 * `make_result`. `dataKeysOf` is therefore pinned against BOTH shapes — the
 * recorded one here, and today's `{results, itinerary}` pairing in "the intent
 * decides which keys are reported" below. Neither is a live staging turn;
 * `scripts/record-captures.sh` is what makes one.
 *
 * test-type: unit (checked-in files; no network, no clock).
