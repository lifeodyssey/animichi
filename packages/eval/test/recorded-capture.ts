/**
 * The recorded turns this package shapes, and the expectation beside each one.
 *
 * Two producers, deliberately, for the reason `dataset-roundtrip.ts` gives:
 * the `.sse` capture is the SUBJECT and `<name>.agent-result.json` is an
 * INDEPENDENT expectation, built by `record_fixtures.py` from the same turn
 * with the eval evaluators' own accessors. A shaper compared against a shape
 * typed by the same hand proves only that the hand was consistent.
 *
 * The transcript read is synthetic and lives here rather than beside the
 * captures: Python never served `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/messages` for these
 * turns, so there is nothing recorded to copy. It is parsed through the
 * contract's own `GetSessionHistoryResponse` so it cannot drift into a shape the
 * edge would never send.
