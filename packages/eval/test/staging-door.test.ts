/**
 * This package opens no second door onto staging (W3-2 #1300).
 *
 * `workers/edge/test/web-search-lane.test.ts` holds the api-test lanes to
 * `lane-origin.ts`; this is the same invariant for the same door's second
 * consumer, and it lives here because a guard on somebody else's files is a
 * guard nobody updates. What it protects is not tidiness: a request that
 * resolved the origin for itself reaches staging with no `x-staging-key` and
 * comes back a Cloudflare 403 block page, which reads as a broken app; and a
 * request that skipped `laneFetch` could follow a redirect carrying both the
 * gate header and a Neon Auth bearer to whatever `Location` named (#1291,
 * #1294).
 *
 * `src/` is held to something stricter still — it makes no request at all. The
 * task takes the door as a port, which is what lets the suites above drive it
 * with a fake, and a `fetch(` appearing there would be a live network call
 * inside a unit test as much as a second door.
 *
 * test-type: unit (reads checked-in files; no network, no clock).
