 * The Python-written record a TS staging run is gated against (W3-5 #1303).
 *
 * The layer and the model are PINNED here rather than exposed as flags. The
 * comparison this package exists to make is "the TS runner on staging against
 * the committed Python run of `agent_eval_v3`", and a gate whose baseline can
 * be pointed elsewhere on the command line can always be made to pass by
 * pointing it somewhere easier. Changing which record W3-5 compares against is
 * a change to this file, in a diff someone reads.
 *
 * These two names are what `baselinePath` flattens into
 * `baselines/agent_l4_trajectory_openai-mimo-v2.5-https---api.xiaomimimo.com-v1.json`
 * — `:`, `@` and `/` each become `-`.

 *
 * It moved off `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1` on 2026-09-07 (#1303). That
 * gateway now answers 400 `MissingSessionID` — "Request is missing
 * x-opencode-session and cannot be routed efficiently" — to every request from
 * every key, and nothing in the Python agent's model construction sends that
 * header, so no Python run can be made against it today. The direct endpoint
 * is the same `mimo-v2.5` and is what staging's own `DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL`
 * names (`workers/edge/wrangler.toml`), so the record now shares an endpoint
 * with the turns it is compared against rather than only a model name. */
