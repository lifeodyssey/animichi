 * The run that loads its strata before it spends a turn (#1478).
 *
 * `loadCaseStrata` used to run inside `gatedResult`, i.e. after
 * `Dataset.evaluate` had taken every case's staging turns: a dataset the gate
 * could not stratify threw there, once the whole run was already paid for, and
 * no result file was written. Loading first is the entire point, so the order
 * lives in one named place both runners call rather than in a line someone can
 * move back up the file.
 *
 * `animichi/tests/eval/strata_first_run.py` was the same shape on
 * the Python side.
