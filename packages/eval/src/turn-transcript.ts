/**
 * One staging turn, read back off the wire as the eight eval evaluators need it
 * (W3-2 #1300, spec `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md` §五:
 * "工具轨迹从 SSE/GET 转录取，不依赖 span tree").
 *
 * THE TRAJECTORY COMES FROM THE FRAMES, NOT FROM A SPAN TREE. Python's
 * evaluators read `AgentResult.steps` — records the in-process runner built as
 * it went. Nothing equivalent crosses the network, and pydantic-evals' official
 * adapters reach for OTel spans that a laptop driving staging over HTTP does not
 * have either. What the deployed edge DOES publish is the SD-9 frames
 * (`workers/edge/src/agent/session/turn-frames.ts`): `tool-input-start` names
 * the tool, `tool-input-available` carries its arguments, and a
 * `tool-output-available` / `-error` under the same `toolCallId` says how it
 * ended. That is the same fact `StepRecord` holds, published rather than
 * remembered.
 *
 * THE PARAMS COME FROM THE TRANSCRIPT READ, AND THAT IS THE POINT (E-2 #1381,
 * owner decision #1311). A frame's `input` is the model's own account of the
 * call; `StepRecord.params` is what the runtime settled that account into, and
 * `ArgumentCorrectness` scores one against the other. Taking both off the
 * stream would make the metric compare a self-statement with itself, so the
 * second record is read from `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/messages`, where the
 * edge publishes the params each tool actually ran with.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TYPE MAY CARRY is bounded by that: exactly the members
 * `evaluators.py` and `official_evaluators.py` read off an `AgentResult`
 * (`_actual_tools`, `_available_data_keys`, `ctx.output.message`,
 * `len(ctx.output.steps)`, each step's `params`), and nothing the wire cannot
 * answer. A member this shaper had to invent would be a metric scored against
 * a guess.
 *
 * Pure: no network, no clock, no environment. The reading is here; the
 * requesting is `staging-turn-task.ts`.
