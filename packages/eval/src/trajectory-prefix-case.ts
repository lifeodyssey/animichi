/**
 * The frozen prefix one exported case carries, read off its own `inputs`
 * (E-1 #1380, spec §十 10.1).
 *
 * NO NEW DATASET FORMAT. `AgentInput.seeded_pending` is already exported —
 * `Mapping[str, object] | None` on the Python side, an open map here — and the
 * five `phase1c_selection_v1` cases are exactly the ones that carry it. This
 * module reads that field; nothing was added to the canonical datasets and no
 * fixture was re-exported.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIELD CANNOT CARRY, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT. `seeded_pending` is
 * the STATE the previous turn left — a reason, an ordered candidate list and a
 * revision — and says nothing about the turn that left it, because Python never
 * took one: `eval_harness._selection_task` set that state directly on an
 * in-process session. Over HTTP a session's state is the trace of its turns, so
 * a turn has to exist, and the only honest one is the MINIMAL turn consistent
 * with the state: the tool that can raise this clarification, called with the
 * work or place the question is about, answered with the offer the question
 * makes, and the question itself as the assistant's words. Every byte below is
 * a function of `seeded_pending`, so two runs of a case derive the same prefix,
 * and nothing here invents a fact the dataset does not already assert.
 *
 * The candidate TITLE stands in for the user's own words, which the dataset
 * does not have. That is the one substitution, and it is stated rather than
 * hidden: an ambiguous ask is by definition one that matched several works, and
 * the first offered title is the only term the exported case names.
