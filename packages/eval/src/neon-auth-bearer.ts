/**
 * Where the staging access token comes from (`docs/ops/auth-migration-neon.md`
 * §4, Path A — the CI default, no inbox involved).
 *
 * Two steps, and the order is the whole recipe: `POST /sign-in/email` answers
 * with an HttpOnly SESSION COOKIE, and `GET /token` exchanges that cookie for
 * the EdDSA JWT the edge verifies. The JSON `token` the first call returns is an
 * opaque session token — presenting it as a bearer to `/token` is a 401, because
 * the bearer plugin is off. Getting that backwards costs an afternoon, so it is
 * written down here rather than rediscovered.
 *
 * This is NOT a second door onto staging. Neon Auth is a different origin behind
 * no WAF rule: it takes no `x-staging-key`, and `CATALOG_API_ORIGIN` is never
 * read here. What it does share with the door is the refusal that matters — a
 * password and a JWT both cross this wire, so a non-HTTPS base URL is refused
 * before either is sent.
