/**
 * The chat bodies one eval case submits, in the order they must be sent.
 *
 * Python's task handed `run_animichi_agent` an in-process `message_history`
 * (`eval_harness._message_history`) and seeded session state directly. Over HTTP
 * neither is possible: the transcript belongs to the session, and the only way
 * to put a prior turn in it is to have taken that turn. So a case with
 * `context.message_history` becomes N+1 submissions on ONE session id — its
 * history turns, then the case's own query.
 *
 * WHAT THAT CHANGES, stated rather than hidden: the recorded `assistant` half of
 * each history turn is NOT what staging will have replied. The dataset's history
 * is a fixture of a conversation; a replay produces the real agent's answers to
 * the same prompts. The user side — which is what the padding, the topic drift
 * and the anime identity in `long_context_v1` are actually testing — is
 * reproduced exactly, including `padding_chars`.
 *
 * `context.last_search_data` and `context.last_location` have NO wire form at
 * all. They were direct seeds of the in-process session, and no `/v1/chat` body
 * carries them; a case that needs one is measuring something this task cannot
 * set up, and W3-5's double run is where that shows.
