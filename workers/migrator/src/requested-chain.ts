 * #1365 — the segment of the bundled chain one request may apply.

 * `expectedHead` is the head the caller asked for, and the apply stops there:
 * a request for A against an A→B bundle applies A and leaves B pending.
 * Unbounded, `applyPending` walked every pending file, so an A request advanced
 * the database to B and only then failed the head check — after the schema had
 * already moved (CodeRabbit on #1471). A ledger standing past the requested
 * head cannot be satisfied by applying anything, so it is refused rather than
 * silently reporting a head the caller did not ask for.
