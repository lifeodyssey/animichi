// asyncpg's direct Postgres hop and the catalog.internal binding are
// non-HTTP/private-hostname traffic that must keep working). This is
// declarative platform config, not NET_ADMIN/iptables (confirmed unavailable on
// Cloudflare Containers — see docs/ops/cloudflare-hardening.md §6): it blocks
// plain-HTTP requests whose URL hostname is a denied literal/glob (the exact

// requested by IP literal over plain HTTP) without requiring `interceptHttps`
// (which would additionally require the container to trust the platform's
