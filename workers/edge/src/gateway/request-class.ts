 * WHICH surface a request is for (EDGE-1 #963), as one pure decision taken once
 * per request. Split out of `gateway/request.ts` when the failure paths landed
 * (EG-06, issue #1343): the class is now read by the dispatch, by the request
 * record on both its entry and completion sides, and by the error record — and
 * the seam that composes those is long enough without it.
 *
 * Reads no binding and takes no dependency on how a class is SERVED, which is
 * what keeps `app.onError` able to name the class of a request that threw.
