/**
 * The identity ladder in front of this Worker's own agent tier (W1-7 #1256).
 *
 * It is the same ladder the container forward has climbed since AUTH-2 #950 — a
 * verified Neon bearer first, else the anonymous pipeline (Turnstile → limiter →
 * budget latch), else a flat 401 — and that is the point of reusing it rather
 * than reimplementing it beside the tier: moving a route onto the new tier must
 * not move it out from behind a wall. Nothing below re-verifies anything; the
 * identity resolved here is the one the intake commits.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE WIDENING, and it is the card's whole reason to exist. Both
 * routes reach the anonymous pipeline here, where the container path gates it on
 * `isAnonymousV1` and `ANON_V1_PATHS` lists only `/v1/chat` — so today an
 * anonymous `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/messages` is a 401. W1's exit criterion
 * is "staging 匿名可完整对话；切走再回来拉到完整结果" (spec §五), which is precisely a
 * visitor with no account reading their own transcript back, so under `edge`
 * that GET must be reachable anonymously or the wave has no exit.
 *
 * What makes it safe is not the route table but `ConversationRetrieval`'s
 * ownership check: the page is returned only when `sessions.user_id` equals the
 * caller's identity, and an anonymous identity is an HMAC of a cookie
 * (`identity/anonymous-id.ts`), so knowing a conversation id buys nothing.
 * Missing and forbidden collapse to the same 404.
 *
 * `ANON_V1_PATHS` is deliberately NOT extended to carry this: that table drives
 * the CONTAINER path, and the flag's contract is that `container` stays byte for
 * byte what it is today. The widening lives on this side of the switch, and
 * `test/agent-turn-routing.test.ts` pins both positions of it.
 *
 * It lives beside `request.ts` instead of inside it because that file is the
 * whole-Worker dispatcher and is already at its size budget, and because these
 * three functions change for exactly one reason — how a turn reaches the agent
 * tier — which is not the dispatcher's reason to change.
