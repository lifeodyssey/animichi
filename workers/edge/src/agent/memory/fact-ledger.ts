/**
 * The two facts a session records about itself (card #1290) — port of
 * `apps/agent`'s `domain/fact_ledger.py::FactLedger`.
 *
 * Deliberately TWO fields and no more, because that is what OQ-3(c) ruled and
 * what `SessionEnvelope` does not already carry: a hard constraint the user
 * stated (today: route pacing) and the episode/scene references behind the
 * points they explicitly selected. Both are derived from the turn's own settled
 * steps by `turn-fact-recorder.ts` — there is no model extraction round, so a
 * fact is a thing a tool was actually called with, never a thing a model said.
 *
 * THE TWO FIELDS HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON PURPOSE:
 * - a hard constraint is an APPEND/SUPERSEDE chain, because "the user changed
 *   their mind from chill to packed" is a correction with a history, and the
 *   live value is the last unsuperseded one;
 * - scene references are a turn-scoped REPLACE-SET, because unchecking a point
 *   has to retire it rather than leave it accumulated. That is also what keeps
 *   the field bounded across a long session.
 *
 * BOTH CAPS ARE ENFORCED IN THE WRITE PATH, not merely asserted by a test: an
 * anonymous identity can keep a route-bearing session alive for a long time,
 * and the per-field record cap plus the encoded byte budget are the only things
 * that make its ledger's size independent of its age. `restored` re-applies
 * them to anything read back from storage, since a value written by another
 * deployment never went through these methods at all.
 *
 * A VALUE OBJECT, like the envelope that carries it: every write answers a new
 * ledger rather than mutating the one the turn opened with.
