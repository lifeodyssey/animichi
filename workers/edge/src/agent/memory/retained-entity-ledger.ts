/**
 * The entities rescued before the tool return that carried them was shrunk
 * (card #1290, rewritten by #1378) — port of `apps/agent`'s
 * `domain/compaction_retention.py::RetainedEntityLedger`.
 *
 * A long tool return is replayed as a short deterministic summary
 * (`session/frozen-tool-return.ts`), and a summary is where a user's own words
 * go missing: the anime title they typed and the place name they asked about
 * are literal strings no summary shape promises to keep. This ledger keeps them
 * verbatim, so an ordinal follow-up ("the first one", "第一个") still has
 * something to resolve against after the raw text is gone.
 *
 * EVICTION IS OLDEST-WINS, not FIFO, and that is the whole point of the module:
 * the entities worth rescuing are the DEEPEST ones. The turn that just ran
 * still has its call's arguments in the context verbatim, so an entity dropped
 * from the tail is repeated a few messages away; a first-turn entity evicted
 * here is gone for good. So once the ledger is full a newer distinct entity is
 * DROPPED rather than allowed to push an older one out.
 *
 * DEDUP IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION, it is what makes an ALARM RETRY idempotent.
 * Since #1378 an entity is rescued once, on the write path, as its return's
 * summary is frozen — not once per turn and not once per model request. But a
 * turn can be attempted more than once, and a retry replays every settled step
 * (`turn-step.ts`) through the same rescue, because an attempt that crashed
 * before its envelope was promoted must not leave the ledger short of what the
 * first attempt recorded. A repeat moves to the tail instead of duplicating, so
 * however many attempts a turn takes, the ledger reads as if it took one.
 *
 * A VALUE OBJECT, like `SessionEnvelope` that carries it: every transition
 * answers a new ledger, so "write the whole thing back once, with the run" is
 * expressible at all.
