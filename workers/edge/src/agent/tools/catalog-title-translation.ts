/**
 * The authoritative half of `translate_anime_title`: the catalog's own Chinese
 * title.
 *
 * Port of `translation.py::_catalog_zh_title` × `_resolved_title_cn`. It answers
 * for exactly one case — an anime title asked for in Chinese — because that is
 * the only case where a curated answer EXISTS: `title_cn` is a column, and a
 * column beats a model. Every other locale falls through to the model path, as
 * it did in Python.
 *
 * Three guards, all ported rather than invented:
 *   - only a `resolved` outcome counts. A disambiguation is several works, and
 *     translating one of them at random would be a guess wearing provenance.
 *   - `looksLikeWrongVariant` rejects a match that is a different entry in the
 *     same series (the sequel-vs-original trap `title-variant-conflict.ts`
 *     exists for), because a confidently wrong sequel title is worse than a
 *     model's honest attempt.
 *   - a blank `title_cn` is no title. The catalog stores an empty string for a
 *     work nobody localized.
 *
 * A catalog outage is not an error here: the model path is a complete answer,
 * so a catalog failure degrades to `null` and the tool never sees it.
 *
 * An ABORT is the exception and propagates immediately. The distinction is not
 * pedantry: degrading it would turn a request that failed BECAUSE the deadline
 * passed into a plain miss, and the chain would then open a model call that
 * starts life already over budget. The tool's own `throwIfAborted` catches a
 * turn that ended without anything throwing (`translate-title-tool.ts`); this
 * catches the far commoner case where the ending is what threw.
