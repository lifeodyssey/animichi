/**
 * Which web sources are reputable, as a label on an untrusted block.
 *
 * Port of `apps/agent/src/animichi/agents/source_tiering.py` (SD-19 P1). The
 * tier is a REPUTATION label and nothing more: a `verified` result is delimited
 * exactly like an unverified one and stays external data. Tiering never
 * upgrades trust — it only tells the model which source to prefer when two
 * results disagree.
 *
 * One deliberate difference from the Python. `urlsplit` reports
 * `evil.example\@wikipedia.org` as the host `wikipedia.org` while a browser
 * navigates to `evil.example`, so `source_tiering._extract_host` had to fail
 * closed on a backslash in the authority. The WHATWG parser this runtime uses
 * has no such split: it resolves that authority to `evil.example` (verified
 * against Node 24), which is the host actually contacted, so the rule would be
 * guarding a confusion that cannot arise here.
