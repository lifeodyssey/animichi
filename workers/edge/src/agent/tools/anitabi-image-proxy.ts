/**
 * Route Anitabi screenshot URLs through this Worker's own image proxy.
 *
 * Port of `apps/agent/src/animichi/agents/handlers/image_url_rewrite.py`. Both
 * schemes are matched by prefix on purpose: an `http://` URL used to pass a
 * naive substring test and ship mixed content to production.
 *
 * One deliberate difference from Python: there is no development bypass. That
 * branch existed because a local FastAPI run had no `/img/` proxy in front of
 * it; the edge Worker always serves one (`src/proxy/image-proxy.ts`), so the
 * rewrite is unconditional and no environment can silently skip it.
