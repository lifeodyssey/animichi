/**
 * The boundary between the public web and the model's context.
 *
 * Port of `apps/agent/src/animichi/agents/web_trust.py`, and the ONE defence
 * that matters on this tool: `web_search` is the agent's only untrusted inbound
 * channel, so every field a stranger wrote is stripped of control characters,
 * stripped of anything that looks like the delimiter itself, truncated, and
 * rendered inside a block the preamble names as data.
 *
 * The preamble and the block shape are kept byte-identical to the Python on
 * purpose. They are what the eval trajectories asserted against and what the
 * system prompt's "Untrusted tool output invariant" paragraph refers to; a
 * rewording here would silently retune both.
 *
 * Stripping the boundary tag is the load-bearing line. Without it a result body
 * carrying a literal `</untrusted_web_result>` would close the block early and
 * everything after it would read as the server's own words — the exact escape
 * the delimiter exists to prevent.
 *
 * NOT ported: `detect_prompt_injection`. Nothing in Python's `web_tools.py`
 * calls it — the web-content half runs from the tool LIFECYCLE bridge
 * (`tool_event_bridge.project_tool_result`) and is log-only, changing no
 * behaviour, and the preflight half belongs to the runner. Both are other
 * cards' ports; a copy here would be a second home for one rule.
