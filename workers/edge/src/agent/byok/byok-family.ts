/**
 * The three model families a BYOK credential can name, and what each one is
 * on the wire (W2-3 #1289, spec §四 S5 + Appendix D).
 *
 * TWO VOCABULARIES MEET HERE, and they are deliberately not merged. The
 * FAMILY is what the caller sends — `openai-compatible` / `anthropic` /
 * `gemini`, the strings `apps/web`'s `byok-storage.ts` puts in
 * `X-BYOK-Provider` and Python's `byok_models.py` accepts. The PROVIDER is
 * what `src/agent/egress/` allowlists — `openai` / `anthropic` / `google`.
 * Renaming either to match the other would break a wire the flag's contract
 * says must not change (`AGENT_TURN_ROUTE` is a fallback flag), so the
 * translation is a table instead.
 *
 * GEMINI RIDES THE OPENAI-COMPATIBLE API, which is a measurement and not a
 * preference: pi-ai's `google-generative-ai` adapter throws "Custom fetch is
 * not supported by the Google Generative AI adapter"
 * (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/api/google-generative-ai.js:33`)
 * the moment an injected fetch is handed to it, so the egress guard cannot
 * hang on that adapter at all. Google publishes the same models on an
 * OpenAI-compatible surface at the SAME host, so the family is driven through
 * `/v1beta/openai/` instead (spike Appendix D, carried into this card by
 * spec §四's "spike 产出的两条实现硬要求").
 *
 * `anthropic-messages`, by contrast, DOES take an injected fetch — it threads
 * `options.fetch` into the SDK client it constructs
 * (`dist/api/anthropic-messages.js:368,663,722`) — so that family keeps its
 * native dialect. `test/byok-turn-model.test.ts` proves it by driving a real
 * pi round trip for both families through a scripted socket.
