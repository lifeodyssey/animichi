/**
 * One bounded probe of a caller's credential (W2-3 #1289) — the edge tier's
 * port of `interfaces/services/byok_probe.py` + `agents/byok_probe.py`.
 *
 * DUAL PURPOSE BY DESIGN (Python's OQ-2 ruling): one upstream request both
 * validates the credential and finds out whether the configured model accepts
 * an image part, so configuring a key costs the caller one probe rather than
 * two. That is why the probe message carries a 1×1 PNG — a model that rejects
 * images is reported as reachable-without-vision, not as broken.
 *
 * THE TAXONOMY IS DELIBERATELY COARSE, because a probe against a
 * caller-chosen endpoint is otherwise a reachability oracle for our egress:
 *   401 / 403      → `byok_credential_rejected` (the one actionable answer)
 *   400 / 422      → reachable, no vision (the model refused the image part)
 *   anything else  → `provider_unreachable`, including a throw, a timeout and
 *                    every other status. Nothing escapes as a fifth outcome.
 *
 * THE STATUS COMES OFF THE SOCKET, not off pi's error text. The guarded fetch
 * already owns the only path a provider request can take, so wrapping its
 * inner fetch is both the most direct reading and one that cannot drift with
 * an adapter's error formatting.
 *
 * THREE CONTAINMENTS, not one, exactly as `byok_probe.py`'s docstring lists
 * them: the coarse taxonomy above, a fixed wall-clock deadline, and a response
 * SIZE cap. The third is the one the guard does not already give — the
 * allowlist decides WHO answers, never how much they say — so a provider
 * having a bad day cannot stream unbounded data into a Worker whose memory is
 * shared with every other request on the isolate. The cap is on the PROBE and
 * not on `GuardedFetch`, because a real turn legitimately streams a long
 * answer; a probe never does.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, ACCEPTED AND NOT SOLVED (Python's issue #481, carried over): the
 * whole-probe deadline bounds how long a caller can wait, but failure LATENCY
 * below it still differs by cause, so a patient attacker can still time
 * open-vs-filtered across many probes.
