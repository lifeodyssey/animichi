/**
 * Whether a pick may answer the question the session has open (card #1288).
 *
 * A port of `apps/agent/src/animichi/agents/selection.py::
 * validate_candidate_selection`, and the ONE place a pick is judged. It answers
 * a value rather than a boolean because the verdict carries the thing the
 * caller needs next — which of the two deterministic paths the pending reason
 * puts this pick on — so no branch downstream has to re-read the reason and
 * re-derive it.
 *
 * Four rules, in Python's order, and the order is part of the port: a stale id
 * is refused before membership, so a pick for a question the session has
 * already answered can never be told whether its ids were real ones.
 *   1. there must BE an open question;
 *   2. the pick must name that question's own id (the stale guard — see
 *      `session-envelope.ts` for why this tier mints one at all);
 *   3. every id picked must be one the question offered;
 *   4. the cardinality must match the question's mode: `anime_ambiguity` takes
 *      as many works as the user wants merged, `place_ambiguity` takes exactly
 *      one place, and any other reason has no selection mode at all.
