/**
 * `plan_multi` — the works a user picked at once, merged and routed (card
 * #1288).
 *
 * Port of `selection.py::execute_multi_selection`. It is the answer to an
 * `anime_ambiguity` clarification where the user said "these, all of them": the
 * works are fetched in PARALLEL, merged deterministically (`merged-works.ts`),
 * and the merge is routed as one itinerary.
 *
 * The terminal vocabulary is Python's and each word is a different fact about
 * the pick, which is why one `error` would not do:
 *   `error`     nothing could be fetched, or the route could not be planned;
 *   `partial`   some work is still syncing — the rows are shown, no route yet;
 *   `empty`     every work answered, and none of them has a spot published;
 *   `too_large` more spots than a route may carry.
 * Only `ok` consumes the clarification. A pick that failed leaves the question
 * open, because the user may reasonably pick differently.
