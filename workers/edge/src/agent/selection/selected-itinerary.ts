 * involved: the browser already knows which spots it wants routed
 * (`apps/web`'s `useSendSelectedPoints`), so the whole turn is one catalog call
 * whose answer is the reply.
 *
 * The ORIGIN is ported exactly, including the part that looks like a bug and is
 * not: `_parse_coordinate_origin` only accepts `"lat,lng"` inside the valid
 * ranges, so a place NAME on that field reaches the catalog as no origin at
 * all. The catalog's `ItineraryInput.origin` would accept the string, but
 * making it do so here would change what a route means on a wire this tier is
 * only a fallback for.
