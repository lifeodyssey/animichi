/**
 * The place a user picked from a `place_ambiguity` clarification (card #1288).

 * Port of `selection.py::execute_place_selection`, and the reason it is not
 * simply "call `search_nearby` again": the candidate the user picked was
 * GEOCODED when the question was asked, and its coordinates were offered with
 * it. Re-geocoding the label would be a second lookup that can disagree with
 * the one the user answered — so this path consumes the staged coordinates and
 * never geocodes at all.
 *
 * It answers `search_nearby`, not an intent of its own: from the visitor's side
 * the result IS a nearby search, and Python emitted the same intent under the
 * same `NearbyMap` component.
