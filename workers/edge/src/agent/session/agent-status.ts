/**
 * The `<agent_status>` bar every model request ends with (card #1379, spec
 * `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md` §九 9.3).
 *
 * These lines used to be the system prompt's `## Trusted runtime context`
 * block, rebuilt per turn from the envelope (#1280, #1290). 李博杰《深入理解 AI
 * Agent》ch.2 实验 2-3 names that shape — 动态系统提示词 — as the most common
 * context-management mistake: a prefix that changes between turns throws away
 * the Prompt Cache for everything after the first differing token, and the
 * prompt is the very first thing in the context.
 *
 * WHY A `user` MESSAGE AT THE END. The book's 「Agent 状态栏在上下文中的具体位置」
 * is explicit that the bar rides "一条 user 角色的消息" appended to the end of the
 * context rather than a rewritten `system` message: last is where the attention
 * weight is, and appending leaves every cached token before it intact. The
 * `user` role is a SLOT the harness borrows, not a claim that a user typed this.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS THIS MODULE IS THE TRUST BOUNDARY, not the channel it rides. The
 * lines below are built from strings the catalog, the geocoder and the user
 * supplied, and the system prompt tells the model this summary is the server's
 * own. Nothing about a `user` message makes that true; `status-value.ts` does,
 * by removing at RENDER time every character a value could close the tag, the
 * line or the `「」` quotes with. The ledgers' own `trustedText` runs earlier and
 * answers a narrower question (control characters, length) — and two of the
 * values here, the resolved title and the clarification candidates, never enter
 * a ledger at all.
 *
 * REPLACED EVERY REQUEST, NEVER PERSISTED — the book's 「状态更新的两种实现与缓存
 * 代价」实现一. `turn-agent.ts` renders it inside `transformContext`, which pi
 * calls on the way into each model request and whose result never re-enters the
 * agent's own message list; `messages` in Neon never sees it either. So exactly
 * one bar exists in any context, it is always the newest state — a tool that
 * resolves the anime mid-turn is on the NEXT request's bar — and the only cache
 * it invalidates is the suffix since the previous request. 实现二（持久追加,
 * Claude Code's `<system-reminder>`) is the wrong trade here: this tier rebuilds
 * the transcript from Neon on every alarm, so stale bars would accumulate in the
 * context without ever earning the append-only cache benefit.
 *
 * MAINTAINED BY CODE ONLY. The book's first caution — 「状态栏尽量用代码维护……
 * 绝不要让它一次性批量统计」, because 「模型几乎无条件地相信状态栏」 — and the
 * facts here were already code-derived (`fact-ledger.ts`: a fact is a thing a
 * tool was called with, never a thing a model said). No summarisation step may
 * be added to this path.
 *
 * It names no tool for the same reason `turn-instructions.ts` names none: the
 * tools are #1253's and their routing table is theirs to write.
