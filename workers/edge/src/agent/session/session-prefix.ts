/**
 * Both halves of the hop that seeds a frozen prefix (E-1 #1380), the way
 * `session-wakeup.ts` owns both halves of `POST /arm`.
 *
 * The seeding must run INSIDE the session's Durable Object, because the
 * envelope it writes lives in that instance's storage and nowhere else (spec
 * §三's single writer, `durable-envelope-store.ts`'s storage decision). So the
 * gateway's job is only to authenticate, and this hop is how the identity it
 * verified reaches the writer.
 *
 * THE IDENTITY RIDES A HEADER, NOT THE BODY, for the reason the BYOK credential
 * does on the arm hop: the body is the CALLER's, byte for byte, and re-wrapping
 * it would put a caller-supplied document and a server-derived fact in one
 * structure where a later reader has to remember which is which. The header is
 * added by `gateway/staging-prefix-route.ts` after `authenticate` returned `ok`
 * and can be added nowhere else — this is a Durable Object stub fetch, which
 * never leaves the account and reaches no router.
 *
 * `APP_ENV` IS NOT CHECKED HERE, and that is deliberate. The mount switch
 * decides whether this route exists on a deployment; it is not an
 * authorisation, so the ownership check below runs on staging exactly as it
 * would anywhere else (`prefix-seeding.ts` owns it).
