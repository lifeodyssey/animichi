/**
 * The SD-9 frames one running turn pushes to whoever is connected (card #1252,
 * spec `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md` §三 "若有连接在则按 SD-9
 * 帧推 SSE").
 *
 * SD-9 is the AI SDK UI message-stream protocol (frontend-rebuild spec §"Global
 * convention: Chat streaming protocol"), so the wire shapes here are not a
 * design decision of this card — they are read off the RECORDED captures the web
 * suite replays, `apps/agent/tests/fixtures/chat_stream/*.sse`, which is also
 * what `apps/web`'s `use-chat-session.ts` feeds to `@ai-sdk/react`. Every frame
 * below appears verbatim in one of those files, including the `data:`-only
 * framing (the protocol carries its discriminator INSIDE the JSON, so an SSE
 * `event:` line would be a second, contradictory one).
 *
 * THE ANSWER RIDES THE SAME FRAMES (#1283). A succeeded turn closes on TWO
 * `data-response` parts under one shared id — the intent alone, then the whole
 * part — which is `chat_stream_frames.data_frames` and is exactly what the
 * captures record. The id is what makes the pair legal rather than a
 * contradiction: SD-9 data parts are OVERWRITTEN in place by id, so the first is
 * the skeleton the web renders while the second is still being built
 * (`apps/web`'s `isIntentOnly`).
 *
 * THE `respond` TOOL IS INVISIBLE HERE, and that is the captures' shape too:
 * Python's final-result tool never became a tool part either — pydantic-ai's
 * `FinalResultEvent` was projected onto the intent-only data part instead
 * (`output_progress_bridge`). A turn's answer is an answer, not a tool call the
 * user watches.
 *
 * Frames are never persisted (§三: "订阅者**不持久化**"). They are a live view
 * of a turn whose truth is in Neon.
