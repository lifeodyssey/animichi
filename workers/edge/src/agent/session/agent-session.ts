/**
 * The `AgentSession` Durable Object — one instance per session, and the place a
 * turn actually runs (card #1252, spec
 * `docs/specs/2026-09-01-agent-ts-rewrite-spec.md` §二/§三).
 *
 * WHY THE TURN RUNS IN `alarm()` AND NOT IN `fetch`: a fetch's wall time is
 * unbounded only while the CALLER stays connected — Cloudflare may cancel the
 * associated work once it hangs up — whereas an `alarm()` handler owns its own
 * 15-minute wall clock, independent of any connection. That is the binding
 * decision of §二, and it is why hanging up cannot stop a turn.
 *
 * The two calls this class answers are two halves of the same contract:
 * - `POST /arm` writes the run id into STORAGE and arms `setAlarm(now)`. The
 *   intake calls it after its transaction commits, and the singleton
 *   `RunSweeper` calls it again for anything stranded; both are idempotent
 *   because the lease decides, not the wake-up (§三).
 * - `GET /stream?runId=` registers an in-memory subscriber and hands back an
 *   SSE body, for a run this session still owes work for; anything else is a
 *   404 the caller reads back instead. `fetch` and `alarm()` run on the same
 *   incarnation and share its heap, which is the entire handoff mechanism;
 *   subscribers are not persisted, so an eviction costs the live view and
 *   nothing else.
 *
 * A plain Durable Object class, like `EdgeGuard` and `RunSweeper`: no
 * `cloudflare:workers` import, so every module it reaches stays importable
 * under `node:test`.
