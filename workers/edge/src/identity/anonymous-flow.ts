 * Issue #447 arms the S1.9 Turnstile gate here, and the order is the point:

 *    we would otherwise have served anonymously (anonymous access off still

 *  - BEFORE the limiter and the container, because the challenge is the outer
 *    wall. Cookie-only identity is free to reset, which resets the per-identity
 *    bucket with it; an unsolved turn must therefore cost neither a bucket slot
 *    (legitimate visitors would pay for their own challenges) nor an LLM call.
