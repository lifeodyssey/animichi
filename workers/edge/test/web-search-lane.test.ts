/**
 * W2-1 (#1287) lane contract: no staging lane can leak its bearer token onto a
 * plaintext wire.
 *
 * `api-test/` talks to a real deployed origin, so this suite cannot execute it
 * — what it CAN do is read the lanes verbatim, exactly as
 * `catalog-api-lane.test.ts` reads its own. The invariant is the one an
 * operator trips by exporting `CATALOG_API_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8787` for a
 * local experiment: those requests carry a real Neon Auth access token, so the
 * origin has to be refused before the token is sent, not after.
 *
 * The check that matters most is the LAST one. A guard on one lane is a guard
 * one new lane forgets, so `lane-origin.ts` is the single door and this asserts
 * that it stays single: any lane resolving `process.env.CATALOG_API_ORIGIN` for
 * itself is a second door, and a second door is one nobody guarded.
 *
 * test-type: unit (reads checked-in files; no network, no clock).
