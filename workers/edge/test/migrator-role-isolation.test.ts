// #1050 — migrator-role isolation contract (Migration Executor, spec
// §"Database identity"). The dedicated `migrator` Postgres role is
// necessarily neon_superuser-grade; minimization is behavioral, and this test
// is the machine-checked half of rule (1): the migrator DSN secret
// (MIGRATOR_DATABASE_URL) must never reach any runtime Worker's standing
// environment. Precedent: the GEMINI_API_KEY removal guard pins a removal by
// scanning config surfaces rather than only the code that reads them.
//
// Rules (1)+(2) used to be pinned against the container env allowlist
// (`CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` / `CONTAINER_REQUIRED_KEYS`); that allowlist was deleted
// with the container in #1605, and the surviving surface is the one this file
// now owns alone: the three runtime Workers' wrangler.toml files.
//
// test-type: unit (reads checked-in files; no network, no clock, no mocks).
