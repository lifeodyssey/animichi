/**
 * W4-1 (#1314): where each deployed environment gets the agent tier's Neon DSN.
 *
 * The agent runs in a CONTAINER, which has no Secrets Store binding of its own,
 * so the DSN only ever travels one way: Pulumi writes a store secret →
 * `[[env.<env>.secrets_store_secrets]]` binds it onto THIS Worker →
 * `CONTAINER_ENV_KEYS` forwards it into the container (and, since W1, the
 * Worker's own agent tier reads it directly). Every link in that chain is a
 * string that has to match a string somebody else wrote, and none of them are
 * checked until a deploy: wrangler resolves `secret_name` against the store at
 * deploy time, and `env.<binding>.get()` throws at runtime.
 *
 * #855 left production deliberately unbound because its store secret did not
 * exist. This card lifts that, and the two facts worth pinning are the ones a
 * careless copy of the staging block would get wrong: staging and production
 * share ONE Cloudflare Secrets Store (the account plan refuses a second), so
 * the two environments' DSNs must differ by `secret_name` — while the BINDING
 * name stays identical, because `container-env.ts` forwards one key regardless
 * of environment.
 *
 * test-type: unit (parses checked-in files; no network, no clock, no mocks).
