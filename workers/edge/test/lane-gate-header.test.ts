/**
 * D3 (#1369): the Cloudflare Access service token and the redirect rule, as the
 * shared lane door actually applies them.
 *
 * The file keeps its name from the `x-staging-key` WAF gate credential #1369
 * replaced — the card's acceptance criterion cites this path — but the gate, its
 * variable and its header are gone; the door presents one credential now.
 *
 * `web-search-lane.test.ts` reads the lanes verbatim — that is what catches a
 * NEW lane forgetting the door — but reading source can only ever prove the
 * code says the right thing. This one runs it.
 *
 * The environment is set per case because the door reads it per call, which is
 * what lets one process drive both the staging branch and the loopback branch.
 * The token is a zero-entropy sentinel: the real one lives in the operator's
 * environment and belongs in no file in this repo.
 *
 * test-type: unit (no network — the transport is a double; no clock).
