/**
 * The deployment a staging lane talks to, and the credential it presents.
 *
 * One door, deliberately. Every file in this directory sends a real request to
 * a real origin, and two of them send a real Neon Auth access token with it, so
 * the checks that decide WHERE that goes cannot live in each lane: three copies
 * are three places for one of them to be forgotten, and the copy that was
 * forgotten is the one an operator finds by leaking a token.
 *
 * Three refusals, all fail-closed:
 *   - an unset origin is never guessed. A lane with no origin has nothing to
 *     assert about, and a lane that invented `localhost` would pass vacuously.
 *   - a non-HTTPS origin is refused before anything is sent (CWE-319), off the
 *     loopback. The very next thing that happens is a bearer token going over
 *     that wire, and an operator who exported `CATALOG_API_ORIGIN=http://…` for
 *     a local experiment would otherwise put a staging credential on it in
 *     plaintext. The loopback exception is the same one `e2e/global-setup.ts`
 *     makes, and for the same reason: `wrangler dev` serves plaintext and there
 *     is no wire to intercept. The refusal is here rather than at the call sites
 *     for the same reason the module exists — `catalog-api.test.ts` carries no
 *     token today, but it is one edit away from carrying one.
 *   - a half-declared Cloudflare Access service token is refused before the
 *     request is built (D3 #1369). Staging is behind an Access application, and
 *     Access answers a request carrying one of the two headers exactly as it
 *     answers one carrying neither — a 302 to the login page. So a lane that
 *     sent half a token would read an HTML login page where it expected JSON and
 *     fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the code under test.
 *     Failing with the missing variable's NAME is the whole point: a redirect
 *     that looks like a broken app costs an afternoon.
 *
 *     A token that is absent ENTIRELY is not an error — that is the loopback
 *     case, and any origin behind no Access application. #1369 deleted the
 *     `x-staging-key` WAF gate this door used to require in the same place; the
 *     Access service token is the one credential staging asks for now.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts` file, so `pnpm run test:catalog-api`'s glob does not run it
 * as a suite; it is imported by the lanes that do.

/**
 * The only way a lane makes a request.

 * A wrapper rather than a `laneHeaders()` a lane remembers to call, for the

 * is a check the next caller forgets, and the request that forgot is the one
 * that comes back 403. Taking the PATH rather than a URL is what makes that
 * structural — a lane cannot reach staging without coming through here.
 *
 * `redirect: "error"` is set AFTER the spread, so no caller can opt out of it,
 * and it is not politeness: `fetch` replays request headers on a followed
 * redirect, so a 30x from staging — a stray trailing slash, a hostile response
 * on a compromised hop — would carry the service token AND the Neon Auth bearer
 * to whatever origin and scheme the `Location` named. There is no legitimate
 * redirect on any of these routes, so a redirect is a finding, and a rejected
 * promise says so where a followed one would say nothing. Cloudflare Access
 * makes it load-bearing rather than defensive (D3 #1369): an unauthenticated
 * request is answered with a 302 to the identity provider, so the one response
 * these lanes are most likely to meet is exactly the one that must not be
 * followed with the credentials attached.
