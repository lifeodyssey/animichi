/**
 * W2-1 (#1287): the **(api)** evidence that `web_search` really leaves the
 * deployed Worker and comes back wrapped.
 *
 * Everything about this tool is unit-tested against a scripted transport, and
 * exactly one thing cannot be: whether Cloudflare's egress can reach
 * `html.duckduckgo.com` at all, and whether that endpoint answers a Worker the
 * way it answered a laptop when the adapter was measured (2026-09-04). That is
 * what this lane is for — a real turn, through the staging edge, whose SSE
 * frames name the tool and carry its output.
 *
 * The assertion on the output is deliberately the UNTRUSTED PREAMBLE rather
 * than the presence of any particular result: the search index is somebody
 * else's and its ranking is not ours to assert, but "whatever came back was
 * wrapped before the model saw it" is the invariant this card exists to keep.
 *
 * Opt-in and fail-closed like every lane here, and signed in for the same
 * reason `agent-turn.test.ts` is: the anonymous door is behind Turnstile.
 *
 * test-type: api (real network against a deployed origin).
