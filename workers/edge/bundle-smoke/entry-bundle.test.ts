/**
 * What the deployed Worker bundle is allowed to contain (issue #1285).
 *
 * The agent tier keeps zod out of `src/` by construction — the schema seam is
 * `packages/contract/scripts/emit-tool-schemas.ts` and the generated module it
 * writes, and every other contract module the Worker reads at runtime is
 * import-free. That property is invisible to `tsc`, to oxlint and to the
 * node:test suite: all three see unbundled source, where a zod-carrying module
 * costs nothing. It is only visible in the artifact — a single value import
 * from a zod module pulls all 79 of zod's files into every isolate the edge
 * starts, for a route table of fourteen strings.
 *
 * So this gate builds `src/entry.ts` the way the deploy path builds it and
 * reads the result. Two assertions, on purpose: the module graph is the
 * structural fact (and names the importer when it regresses), while the
 * `ZodError` marker is what a reviewer can grep the shipped file for.
 *
 * Mutation proof (recorded on the card): put the pre-#1285 world back — re-add
 * `export { AGENT_PATHS } from "./agent-paths.js"` to the contract's
 * `agent-contract.ts`, then point `src/gateway/routing-policy.ts` (or
 * `rate-policy.ts`, which imports the same table) at it — and both assertions
 * fail, the first naming `agent-contract.ts` as the importer. Flipping the
 * import alone no longer builds: the zod modules deliberately re-export
 * neither constant, which is a second and coarser guard, not this one.
 *
 * test-type: unit (hermetic — no network, no clock; esbuild over the tree).
