# apps/web — AGENTS.md

TanStack Start app replacing the retired Next.js frontend at cutover. `/` is a responsive doorway:
it serves a minimal indexable summary, hands mobile visitors (`<=640px`) to `/chat` on the first
client effect, and keeps desktop visitors on the clickable doorway. Root guide: `../../AGENTS.md`.

## Commands (from `apps/web/`)

- `pnpm run dev` — Vite dev server.
- `pnpm run build` — Vite/Nitro Cloudflare build; emits `.output/server/index.mjs` + public assets.
- `pnpm test` — Vitest unit suite with Istanbul coverage.
- `pnpm run test:integration` — build-output and Wrangler dry-run integration checks.
- `pnpm run typecheck` — TypeScript 7.0.2 `tsc --noEmit`.
- `pnpm run lint:oxlint` — type-aware oxlint with warnings denied.
- `pnpm run preview` — `wrangler dev` against the built `.output` entry.

## Conventions

- TanStack file routes live in `src/routes/`; create the router in `src/router.tsx`.
- Keep production functions at ≤10 lines and tests at ≤50. `apps/web/.oxlintrc.json` owns both
  limits and extends the root strict, type-aware config.
- Use semantic tokens from `src/styles/globals.css`; alignment tests pin the Animal Island token
  layer.
- Keep legacy and rebuild E2E origins separate until cutover: `E2E_WEB_BASE_URL` targets this app.

## API layer (`src/api/`)

- Transport is oRPC `OpenAPILink` (the catalog/users Workers run `OpenAPIHandler`, not RPC).
  `clients.ts` exposes separate `createCatalogClient` / `createUsersClient` factories — each has its
  own base URL and forwards cookie/`Authorization` headers from the per-call `ApiClientContext`.
- `orpc.ts` wraps clients in `@orpc/tanstack-query` utils with disjoint key prefixes
  (`["catalog", …]` / `["users", …]`); consume them via query hooks in `src/api/hooks/` — UI never
  touches the transport directly (dependency points inward: component → hook → client).
- `config.ts` resolves per-service base URLs and the SSR absolute origin (`VITE_SITE_ORIGIN` on the
  server, `location.origin` in the browser). `query-client.ts` builds a fresh `QueryClient`; `getRouter`
  creates one per request and `routerWithQueryClient` wires dehydrate/hydrate (no cross-request leak,
  no double fetch).
- MSW has three swimlanes (`tests/msw/`): `node.ts` (`setupServer`, component/loader unit tests),
  `browser.ts` (`setupWorker`, client-navigation tests). SSR is deliberately NOT covered by MSW —
  it is validated against a real local Worker + backend at the G1 gate. Handlers never hand-write
  JSON: `contract-handler.ts` `parse()`s requests and responses against the `@animichi/contract`
  zod schemas and builds oRPC-typed error envelopes.

## Dependency direction (UI → features → clients/platform; never reverse)

- One-way layering, enforced by convention and peer review (no lint plugin exists; a back-edge is
  a review blocker):
  1. `src/routes/` and `src/components/` — UI. May import features, `src/api/hooks/`, `src/lib/`.
  2. `src/features/*/` — feature units. May import `src/api/` clients/hooks, `src/lib/`,
     `src/platform/`. Prefer no imports from other features' internals — share via `src/lib/`
     or `src/api/hooks/`. **Known exception:** map geometry/controller under
     `src/features/bubble-map/` is a shared map primitive used by chat maps until a
     `src/lib/map/` extract (TODO(refactor-skeleton): see #842).
  3. `src/api/` (transport + hooks) · `src/lib/` (pure utilities) · `src/platform/` — never import
     UI or features. Nothing may reverse this order.
- A feature owns everything it needs under `src/features/<feature>/` — components/, hooks, and a
  `lib/` subfolder for pure logic. `src/lib/` is reserved for cross-cutting/platform-adjacent
  utilities (auth, byok, turnstile, route-detail); it must never hold a feature's code twice.
- Chat is single-homed (consolidated in #842): its pure logic lives in
  `src/features/chat/lib/` — do NOT recreate `src/lib/chat/`.
- Remaining dual home tracked in #842: `route-detail` still spans `src/lib/route-detail/` +
  `src/components/route-detail/`; consolidate under `src/features/route-detail/` and delete
  `src/lib/route-detail/` (see the `TODO(refactor-skeleton)` markers in that folder).

## Key files + entrypoints

- `src/routes/__root.tsx` — document shell, metadata, error/not-found wiring.
- `src/routes/index.tsx` → `src/features/seo/DoorwaySummary.tsx` — the served `/` body.
- `src/components/settings/` + `src/components/ds/` — the ⚙ panel's app preferences (day/night
  `Switch`, language `Select`), composed at the UI layer and injected into the chat panel.
- `src/components/NotFound.tsx` — branded 404.
- `src/router.tsx` — TanStack router factory.
- `vite.config.ts` — TanStack Start/Nitro/React build composition.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — `.output/server/index.mjs` Worker entry + static asset binding.
- `tests/unit/` · `tests/integration/build-output.test.ts` — unit and emitted-bundle contracts.

## Pitfalls

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated. Do not hand-edit it; oxlint and coverage ignore it. The unit
  pool runs without the TanStack Start vite plugin, so `tests/setup/generate-route-tree.ts`
  (vitest `globalSetup`) emits it before the suite; a normal build regenerates it otherwise.
- Coverage sweeps `src/**` (routes + `router.tsx` included, per campaign plan §0.6); the enforced
  floor is `statements 98 / branches 95 / functions 98 / lines 99`, read from `vitest.config.ts`,
  which is the authority — ratchet UP only. `routeTree.gen.ts` is the only exclusion (plus the
  WebGL map glue listed in the config's exclude ledger).
- `OpenAPILink` captures `globalThis.fetch` at construction: build clients at call time (the lazy
  `catalog()` / `users()` singletons do), not at module top, or MSW patching is missed in tests.
- A normal build must run before preview or build-output integration checks inspect `.output/`.
- Root lint strictness applies here; do not copy the frozen `frontend/` ESLint setup.
