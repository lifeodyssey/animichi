# The lane-segment manifest (card B1 / #1359, from the B0 review hand-off).
#
# After #1358 a package's `test` script IS its CI lane: the affected matrix and
# the pre-push hook both run `pnpm --filter <package> run test` and nothing
# else. That makes the chain inside `test` load-bearing and, until this file,
# unguarded — deleting `&& pnpm run test:ratelimit-namespace` from the edge
# package left every gate green while a real check had stopped running.
#
# The manifest below is the declaration of which segments each package's `test`
# must chain. Two directions are checked, because either alone is a fail-open:
# a listed segment must appear in the `test` script AND be a script the package
# actually defines, and a workspace package that defines `test` without being
# listed here is a violation too (a new lane cannot enter unnoticed).
#
# Usage: ruby .github/scripts/test_package_test_segments.rb [REPO_ROOT]
