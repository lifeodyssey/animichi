# A gitleaks config file REPLACES the built-in rule set unless it extends it.
# `.gitleaks.toml` sits at the repo root, so every consumer auto-discovers it:
# the digest-pinned scanner in .github/actions/secret-scan (job `security-diff`)
# and the gitleaks pre-commit hook. Drop `[extend] useDefault = true` and both
# keep exiting 0 on real secrets — a silent, total loss of secret scanning that
# no other check would notice. Narrower edits buy the same silence while
# `useDefault = true` still reads fine, so each is rejected too: `[extend]
# disabledRules` drops named rules back out of the inherited set, and the
# `[allowlist]` keys suppress findings by file path (`paths`), by secret value
# (`regexes`) and by substring of the secret (`stopwords`). The `contracts` job
# has no gitleaks binary, so this guard is static: it reads the config's TOML
# tables directly.
