// ── Staging: the Cloudflare Access front door (D3 #1369) ─────────────────────
// Staging runs the same app as production *with anonymous access on*
// (`ANON_ACCESS_ENABLED = "true"` in `workers/edge/wrangler.toml`
// `[env.staging.vars]`), so there is no login of its own keeping strangers out.
// Access is that login: humans sign in against
// the identity policy below, automation presents the service token, and both
// are decided by Cloudflare before a request is billed as a Worker invocation.
//
// It replaces the WAF custom rule this file's neighbour used to declare. That
// rule could only ever cover hostnames on the zone, which left the two
// `*.workers.dev` origins CD actually smoke-tests wide open (#539) — an Access
// application takes them as ordinary public destinations.
//
// Shipped in two PRs on purpose: an application enforces the moment its policy
// exists, so PR 1 minted the token and taught every caller the two headers, and
// this one puts the door in front of them. Access is eventually consistent
// (spec §六 第 2 条), so enforcement lags the apply by a minute or two.
//
// Staging only. Production has no Access application — it has a real login —
// and `topology-prod.test.ts` pins that nothing here is built there.

 * `selfHostedDomains` would take the same strings, and is what a search still

 * sunset outright: "This field is deprecated in favor of `destinations` and
 * will be supported until **November 21, 2025.** If `destinations` are
 * provided, then `selfHostedDomains` will be ignored"
 * (`@pulumi/cloudflare@6.19.0`, `zeroTrustAccessApplication.d.ts` — the
 * `selfHostedDomains?` member of `ZeroTrustAccessApplicationArgs`). That date is
 * behind us, and the failure mode of a field the API has stopped reading is the
 * silent one: the application would exist, cover its primary `domain` alone,
 * and leave the two workers.dev origins open with everything green.
 *
 * A public destination carries a `uri`, not a `hostname` — `hostname` is the
 * private-network form ("Matches a valid SNI served by an HTTPS origin"), while
 * `uri` is documented as "Public destinations' URIs can include a domain and
 * path" and is what the provider's own example uses
 * (`ZeroTrustAccessApplicationDestination`, `types/input.d.ts:16196-16226`).
 * A bare hostname is a whole-host URI, which is what this wants.
 *
 * `type: "public"` and not `"worker"`: the account-level Worker destination
 * types Cloudflare shipped in 2026-08 are not in this provider's schema at all —
 * its enum is "public", "private".
 *
 * Both facts below are measured, not inferred (N4b, 2026-09-08, throwaway app on
 * an idle workers.dev host, deleted afterwards):
 *
 *   - `destinations[].uri` DOES enforce on a workers.dev host. Once Access had
 *     propagated (~20 s) a path reached only through `destinations` answered 403
 *     bare and passed through to the Worker with the two headers, exactly as the
 *     `domain` spelling N4 probed did.
 *   - **The API requires `domain` to be one of the destinations.** Creating an
 *     application whose `domain` was absent from the list was refused outright:
 *     `12130 access.api.error.invalid_request: domain not included in
 *     destinations`. `securedHostnames()` puts `stagingDomain` first and
 *     `publishAccessApplication` passes the same value as `domain`, which is what
 *     satisfies that rule; `topology-staging-access.test.ts` pins the pairing,
 *     because getting it wrong is not a wrong door but a failed apply.
 *   - **A `uri` is path-scoped.** In the probe a third path, named in no
 *     destination, reached the Worker unauthenticated. These are bare hostnames
 *     on purpose: a bare host is the whole host. Appending a path to one here
 *     would quietly un-protect everything else on it.
