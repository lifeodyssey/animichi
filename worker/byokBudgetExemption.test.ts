// #284 Task 4 regression lock (edge half): an AUTHENTICATED `/v1/chat`
// request must never consult `budgetLatched` — that check is reachable
// only from `handleAnonymousV1`. This is the property that makes BYOK's
// quota exemption "free" (no new edge code needed): a future refactor that
// moved the breaker onto the shared authenticated path would silently start
// rejecting logged-in (and therefore BYOK) traffic.
//
// #479 P1 review follow-up (Fable): the first version of this file latched
// a FIXED test day (`Date.UTC(2026, 6, 28, ...)`) while the guard's own
// `handleGuardRequest` was driven by that SAME fixed `NOW` — so a mutation
// that actually wired `budgetLatched(env.EDGE_GUARD, utcDayKey(Date.now()))`
// into `authenticatedForward` was proven NOT to be caught: the mutated
// check would read "today" from the REAL system clock, find nothing
// latched there (only the fixed test day was latched), and pass through
// anyway — the test stayed green for the wrong reason. Fixed two ways: (1)
// latch the REAL current day (`utcDayKey(Date.now())`), matching what any
// clock-driven implementation — present or future — would derive, and (2)
// additionally assert directly on the guard's own call trace that no
// `/budget` GET ever reached the shard, which is a stronger, mechanism-level
// pin than the response status alone.
